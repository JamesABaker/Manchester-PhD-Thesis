 For UniHuman and ExpAll , we plotted absolute abundance of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, lysine, arginine, and leucine at each position (i.e., it scales as the equivalent fraction in the total composition of the alignment column) (Figure~\ref{fig:single_pass_charge_distribution}).[m
 To note, the known preference of positively charged residues towards the cytoplasmic side is nevertheless evident.[m
 Yet, it becomes apparent that any bias in the occurrence of the much rarer acidic residues is overshadowed by fluctuations in the highly abundant residues such as leucine.[m

 This is not an effect of the flank definition selection since the trend remains the same when using the database-defined flanks without the context of the~\gls{tmh} (Figure~\ref{fig:single_pass_charge_distribution}).[m
 For UniHuman, the negative charge expectancy on the inside flank doesn’t reach above 2\% until position -10 (D) and position -11 (E), whereas, on the outside flank, both D and E start $>$2\%.[m
 The same can be seen in ExpAll where negative residues reach above 2\% only as far from the membrane boundary as at position -9 (D) and position -7 (E) on the inside but exceed 2\% beginning with position 1 (D) and 3 (E) on the outside (Figure~\ref{fig:single_pass_charge_distribution}).[m

 The observation of negative charge suppression at the inside flank, herein the ``negative-inside depletion'' rule, is statistically significant throughout most datasets in this study.[m
 The inside-outside bias was counted using the~\gls{kw} test comparing the occurrence of acidic residues within 10 residues of each~\gls{tmh} inside and outside the~\gls{tmh} (Table~\ref{table:negativeskewsinglepass}).[m
 We studied both the database-reported flanks as well as those obtained from central alignment of~\gls{tmh}s (see Methods).[m

 Under condition (i), we find with ExpAll that aspartic acid has a background level of 1.0\%, an average of 2.6\% on the inside flank, and of 2.9\% on the outside flank but glutamic acid’s background is 1.2\% but 2.8\% on the inside flank and 2.5\% on the outside flank.[m

 Apparently, the problem is~\gls{tmh}s having no or almost no flanks at one of the sides.[m
[31m-Statistical significance for the negative charge bias is detected as soon as this problem is dealt with – either by allowing extension of flanks overlap among neighbouring~\gls{tmh}s as in condition (iii) or by kicking out examples without proper flank lengths from the dataset as in condition (iv).[m

 The issues we had with ExpAll raised the question that, maybe, sequence redundancy in the UniHuman set could have played a role.[m
 Therefore, we repeated all calculations but with UniRef50 instead of UniRef90 for mapping into sequence clusters (see Methods section for detail).[m
 We were surprised to see that harsher sequence redundancy requirements do not affect the outcome of the statistical tests in any major way.[m
[31m-For the conditions (i)- (iv), we computed the following P\--values: (i) 1.31e-28 (5940 negatively residues inside versus 7492 outside), (ii) 1.38e-36 (5516 versus 7320), (iii) 5.60e-53 (7089 versus 9233) and (iv) 4.18e-41 (4232 versus 5730).[m

 [m
 So, the amplifying effect of some subsets in the overall dataset on the statistical test that might be caused by allowing overlapping flanks (condition (iii)) is not the major factor leading to the negative charge skew.[m
 Similarly, the trend is also not caused by sequence redundancy.[m

 To examine the statistical significance of these observations, we compared the amino acid distributions (K, R, K+R, D, E, D+E, Y, W, L, C) across the range of~\gls{tmh}s with flank lengths $\pm$10 residues using the~\gls{ks},~\gls{kw} and the \({\chi}^{2}\) statistical tests.[m
 To note, the~\gls{ks} test scrutinises for significant maximal absolute differences between distribution curves; the gls{kw} test is after skews between distributions and the \({\chi}^{2}\) statistical test checks the average difference between distributions.[m

 \section{Discussion}[m
 [m
 The ``negative-outside/non-negative inside'' skew in~\gls{tmh}s and their flanks is statistically significant[m
 We have seen that, consistently throughout the datasets, there is a trend for generally rare negatively charged residues to prefer the outside flank of a~\gls{tmh} rather than the inside (and to almost completely avoid the~\gls{tmh} itself); be it by suppression on the inside and/or enrichment on the outside.[m
[31m-The trend is much stronger in single-pass protein datasets than in multi-pass protein datasets.[m
[32m+[m[32mThe trend is much stronger in single\--pass protein datasets than in multi\--pass protein datasets.[m
 However as we elaborated on further, the real crux of the bias appears to be associated with the~\gls{tmh} being simple or complex~\cite{Wong2011, Wong2012}, thus, whether or not the~\gls{tmh} has a role beyond anchorage.[m
 The existence of this bias has implications for topology prediction of proteins with~\gls{tmh}s, engineering membrane proteins as well as for models of protein transport via membranes and protein-membrane stability considerations.[m
 [m
[31m-It should be noted that the controversy in the scientific community about the existence of a negative charge bias at~\gls{tmh}s was mainly with regard to multi-pass~\gls{tmp}s.[m

 Despite having access to much larger, better annotated sequence datasets and many more 3D structures than our predecessors, we also had our share of difficulties here (see Results section \ref{section:negativeskewmultipass} and Table \ref{table:multipassstats}).[m
 The straightforward approach results in inconclusive statistical tests if datasets become small (for example, if selections are restricted to subcellular localisations, 3D structures or if very harsh sequence redundancy criteria are applied) and, especially, if~\gls{tmh}s with very short or no flanks are included.[m
[31m-Therefore in the case of multi-pass proteins, we studied flanks as taken from the TM boundaries in the databases under several conditions: (i) without allowing flank overlap between neighbouring~\gls{tmh}s, (ii) as subset of (i) but with requiring some minimal flank length at either side, (iii) with overlapping flanks.[m

 We also studied flanks after central alignment of~\gls{tmh}s and assuming standardised~\gls{tmh} length.[m
[31m-Multi-pass~\gls{tmh}s (without overlapping flanks) do not show statistically significant negative charge bias under condition (i) but, apparently, due to many~\gls{tmh}s without any or super-short flanks at least at one side.[m

 Significance appears as soon as subsets of~\gls{tmh}s with flanks at both sides are studied.[m
 Not surprisingly, there is no charge bias if there are no flanks in the first place.[m
[31m-It is perhaps worth noting that the results from multi-pass~\gls{tmh}s with overlapping flanks may involve amplification of skews since it involves multiple counting of the same residues.[m

 For example, aspartic acid and glutamic acid can drive efficient di- or trimerisation of~\gls{tmh}s in lipid bilayers and, furthermore, that aspartic acid interactions with neighbouring~\gls{tmh}s can directly increase insertion efficiency of marginally hydrophobic~\gls{tmh}s via the Sec61 translocon~\cite{Meindl-Beinker2006}.[m

In this work, we build on recent developments in the area of deep learning and investigate the usefulness of multi-task deep neural networks (MTDNN), which consist of upstream shared layers upon which are stacked in parallel as many independent modules (additional hidden layers with their own output units) as the number of output GO terms (the tasks). MTDNN learns individual tasks partially using shared representations and partially from task-specific characteristics. When no close homologues with experimentally validated functions can be identified, MTDNN gives more accurate predictions than baseline methods based on annotation frequencies in public databases or homology transfers. More importantly, the results show that MTDNN binary classification accuracy is higher than alternative machine learning-based methods that do not exploit commonalities and differences among prediction tasks. Interestingly, compared with a single-task predictor, the performance improvement is not linearly correlated with the number of tasks in MTDNN, but medium size models provide more improvement in our case. One of advantages of MTDNN is that given a set of features, there is no requirement for MTDNN to have a bootstrap feature selection procedure as what traditional machine learning algorithms do. Overall, the results indicate that the proposed MTDNN algorithm improves the performance of protein function prediction. On the other hand, there is still large room for deep learning techniques to further enhance prediction ability.},[m

Identifying the correct orientation allows us to study the complex relationship between sequence, structure and the lipid environment, which is otherwise challenging to investigate using experimental techniques due to the difficulty in crystallising membrane proteins embedded within intact membranes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We have developed a knowledge-based membrane potential, calculated by the statistical analysis of transmembrane protein structures, coupled with a combination of genetic and direct search algorithms, and demonstrate its use in positioning proteins in membranes, refinement of membrane protein models and in decoy discrimination.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our method is able to quickly and accurately orientate both alpha-helical and beta-barrel membrane proteins within the lipid bilayer, showing closer agreement with experimentally determined values than existing approaches.

For this, the transfer of full sequences of amino-acid residues into the bilayer, rather than individual amino acids, must be understood. Earlier studies have revealed that the most likely reference state for partitioning very hydrophobic sequences is the membrane interface. We have used $\mu$s-scale simulations to calculate the interface-to-transmembrane partitioning free energies $\Delta$GS→TM for two hydrophobic carrier sequences in order to estimate the insertion free energy for all 20 amino acid residues when bonded to the center of a partitioning hydrophobic peptide. Our results show that prior single-residue scales likely overestimate the partitioning free energies of polypeptides. The correlation of $\Delta$GS→TM with experimental full-peptide translocon insertion data is high, suggesting an important role for the membrane interface in translocon-based insertion. The choice of carrier sequence greatly modulates the contribution of each single-residue mutation to the overall partitioning free energy. Our results demonstrate the importance of quantifying the observed full-peptide partitioning equilibrium, which is between membrane interface and transmembrane inserted, rather than combining individual water-to-membrane amino acid transfer free energies.},[m

[32m+[m[32mabstract = {Previous experiments on the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator suggested that non-native polar residues within membrane domains can compromise protein structure/function. However, depending on context, replacement of a native residue by a non-native residue can result either in genetic disease or in benign effects (e.g., polymorphisms). Knowledge of missense mutations that frequently cause protein malfunction and subsequent disease can accordingly reveal information as to the impact of these residues in local protein environments. We exploited this concept by performing a statistical comparison of disease-causing mutations in protein membrane-spanning domains versus soluble domains. Using the Human Gene Mutation Database of 240 proteins (including 80 membrane proteins) associated with human disease, we compared the relative phenotypic propensity to cause disease of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids when removed from-or inserted into-native protein sequences. We found that in transmembrane domains (TMDs), mutations involving polar residues, and ionizable residues in particular (notably arginine), are more often associated with protein malfunction than soluble proteins. To further test the hypothesis that interhelical cross-links formed by membrane-embedded polar residues stabilize TMDs, we compared the occurrence of such residues in the TMDs of mesophilic and thermophilic prokaryotes. Results showed a significantly higher proportion of ionizable residues in thermophilic organisms, reinforcing the notion that membrane-embedded electrostatic interactions play critical roles in TMD stability.},[m

 abstract = {Transmembrane helices (TMHs) frequently occur amongst protein architectures as means for proteins to attach to or embed into biological membranes. Physical constraints such as the membrane's hydrophobicity and electrostatic potential apply uniform requirements to TMHs and their flanking regions; consequently, they are mirrored in their sequence patterns (in addition to TMHs being a span of generally hydrophobic residues) on top of variations enforced by the specific protein's biological functions. With statistics derived from a large body of protein sequences, we demonstrate that, in addition to the positive charge preference at the cytoplasmic inside (positive-inside rule), negatively charged residues preferentially occur or are even enriched at the non-cytoplasmic flank or, at least, they are suppressed at the cytoplasmic flank (negative-not-inside/negative-outside (NNI/NO) rule). As negative residues are generally rare within or near TMHs, the statistical significance is sensitive with regard to details of TMH alignment and residue frequency normalisation and also to dataset size; therefore, this trend was obscured in previous work. We observe variations amongst taxa as well as for organelles along the secretory pathway. The effect is most pronounced for TMHs from single-pass transmembrane (bitopic) proteins compared to those with multiple TMHs (polytopic proteins) and especially for the class of simple TMHs that evolved for the sole role as membrane anchors. The charged-residue flank bias is only one of the TMH sequence features with a role in the anchorage mechanisms, others apparently being the leucine intra-helix propensity skew towards the cytoplasmic side, tryptophan flanking as well as the cysteine and tyrosine inside preference. These observations will stimulate new prediction methods for TMHs and protein topology from a sequence as well as new engineering designs for artificial membrane proteins.},[m

 abstract = {Lipids play key roles in Biology. Mechanical properties of the lipid bilayer influence their neighbouring membrane proteins, however it is unknown whether different membrane protein properties have the same dependence on membrane mechanics, or whether mechanics are tuned to specific protein processes of the protein. We study the influence of lipid lateral pressure and electrostatic effects on the in vitro reconstitution, folding, stability and function of a representative of the ubiquitous major facilitator transporter superfamily, lactose permease. Increasing the outward chain lateral pressure in the bilayer, through addition of lamellar phosphatidylethanolamine lipids, lowers lactose permease folding and reconstitution yields but stabilises the folded state. The presence of phosphatidylethanolamine is however required for correct folding and function. An increase in headgroup negative charge through the addition of phosphatidylglycerol lipids favours protein reconstitution but is detrimental to topology and function. Overall the in vitro folding, reconstitution, topology, stability and function of lactose permease are found to have different dependences on bilayer composition. A regime of lipid composition is found where all properties are favoured, even if suboptimal. This lays ground rules for rational control of membrane proteins in nanotechnology and synthetic biology by manipulating global bilayer properties to tune membrane protein behaviour.},[m

Because the Sec61 protein-conducting channel has been isolated in multiple membrane-derived complexes, we determined how the nascent polypeptide modulates translocon component associations during defined cotranslational translocation events. The model substrate preprolactin (pPL) was isolated principally with Sec61$\alpha$$\beta$$\gamma$ upon membrane targeting, whereas higher-order complexes containing OST, TRAP, and TRAM were stabilized following substrate translocation. Blocking pPL translocation by passenger domain folding favored stabilization of an alternate complex that contained Sec61, Sec62, and Sec63. Moreover, Sec62/63 stabilization within the translocon occurred for native endogenous substrates, such as the prion protein, and correlated with a delay in translocation initiation. These data show that cotranslational translocon contacts are ultimately controlled by the engaged nascent chain and the resultant substrate-driven translocation events.},[m

 abstract = {Cotranslational translocation of proteins across the mammalian ER membrane involves, in addition to the signal recognition particle receptor and the Sec61p complex, the translocating chain-associating membrane (TRAM) protein, the function of which is still poorly understood. Using reconstituted proteoliposomes, we show here that the translocation of most, but not all, secretory proteins requires the function of TRAM. Experiments with hybrid proteins demonstrate that the structure of the signal sequence determines whether or not TRAM is needed. Features that distinguish TRAM-dependent and -independent signal sequences include the length of their charged, NH2-terminal region and the structure of their hydrophobic core. In cases where TRAM is required for translocation, it is not needed for the initial interaction of the ribosome/nascent chain complex with the ER membrane but for a subsequent step inside the membrane in which the nascent chain is inserted into the translocation site in a protease-resistant manner. Thus, TRAM functions in a signal sequence-dependent manner at a critical, early phase of the translocation process.},[m

During this process, membrane spanning segments may adopt two distinct orientations with either their N- or C-terminus translocated into the ER lumen. While different topogenic determinants in membrane proteins, such as flanking charges, polypeptide folding, and hydrophobicity, have been identified, it is not well understood how the translocon and/or associated components decode them. Here we present evidence that the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex is involved in membrane protein topogenesis in vivo. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of the TRAP complex in HeLa cells enhanced the topology effect of mutating the flanking charges of a signal-anchor, but not of increasing signal hydrophobicity. The results suggest a role of the TRAP complex in moderating the ‘positive-inside' rule.},[m

The latter process is mediated by a membrane protein complex that consists of the Sec61p complex and the Sec62p-Sec63p subcomplex. In contrast, in mammalian cells protein translocation is almost exclusively co-translational. This transport depends on the Sec61 complex, which is homologous to the yeast Sec61p complex and has been identified in mammals as a ribosome-bound pore-forming membrane protein complex. We report here the existence of ribosome-free mammalian Sec61 complexes that associate with two ubiquitous proteins of the ER membrane. According to primary sequence analysis both proteins display homology to the yeast proteins Sec62p and Sec63p and are therefore named Sec62 and Sec63, respectively. The probable function of the mammalian Sec61-Sec62-Sec63 complex is discussed with respect to its abundance in ER membranes, which, in contrast to yeast ER membranes, apparently lack efficient post-translational translocation activity.},[m

 abstract = {Signal recognition particle (SRP) is a ribonucleoprotein consisting of six distinct polypeptides and one molecule of small cytoplasmic 7SL RNA. It was previously shown to promote the co-translational translocation of secretory proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum by (a) arresting the elongation of the presecretory nascent chain at a specific point, and (b) interacting with the SRP receptor, an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum which is active in releasing the elongation arrest. Recently a procedure was designed by which the particle could be disassembled into its protein and RNA components. We have further separated the SRP proteins into four homogeneous fractions. When recombined with each other and with 7SL RNA, they formed fully active SRP. Particles missing specific proteins were assembled in the hope that some of these would retain some functional activity. SRP(-9/14), the particle lacking the 9-kD and 14-kD polypeptides, was fully active in promoting translocation, but was completely inactive in elongation arrest. This implied that elongation arrest is not a prerequisite for protein translocation. SRP receptor was required for SRP(-9/14)-mediated translocation to occur, and thus must play some role in the translocation process in addition to releasing the elongation arrest.},[m

The Mr of the SRP-arrested nascent preprolactin chain was estimated to be 8,000 corresponding to approximately 70 amino acid residues. Because the signal sequence of preprolactin comprises 30 residues and because approximately 40 residues of the nascent chain are buried (protected from protease) in the large ribosomal subunit, we conclude that it is the interaction of SRP with the amino-terminal signal peptide of the nascent chain (emerged from the large ribosomal subunit) that modulates translation and thereby causes an arrest in chain elongation. This arrest is released upon SRP-mediated binding of the elongation-arrested ribosomes to the microsomal membrane, resulting in chain completion and translocation into the microsomal vesicle.},[m

SRbeta can be cross-linked to a 21 kDa ribosomal protein in its empty and GDP-bound state, but not when GTP is bound. GTP binding to SRbeta is required to induce signal sequence release from SRP.

For co-translational translocation, additional SRP components are required. We discuss the implications of our results for the function of the Escherichia coli SRP which is homologous to the SRP54/SRP-RNA complex.},[m

Using protein cross-linking, we detected distinct modes in the binding of SRP to the ribosome. During signal peptide recognition, SRP54 is positioned at the exit site close to ribosomal proteins L23a and L35. When SRP54 contacts SR, SRP54 is rearranged such that it is no longer close to L23a. This repositioning may allow the translocon to dock with the ribosome, leading to insertion of the signal peptide into the translocation channel.},[m

Both substrate analogs are contacted exclusively by conserved ribosomal RNA (rRNA) residues from domain V of 23S rRNA; there are no protein side-chain atoms closer than about 18 angstroms to the peptide bond being synthesized. The mechanism of peptide bond synthesis appears to resemble the reverse of the acylation step in serine proteases, with the base of A2486 (A2451 in Escherichia coli) playing the same general base role as histidine-57 in chymotrypsin. The unusual pK(a) (where K(a) is the acid dissociation constant) required for A2486 to perform this function may derive in part from its hydrogen bonding to G2482 (G2447 in E. coli), which also interacts with a buried phosphate that could stabilize unusual tautomers of these two bases. The polypeptide exit tunnel is largely formed by RNA but has significant contributions from proteins L4, L22, and L39e, and its exit is encircled by proteins L19, L22, L23, L24, L29, and L31e.},[m

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alpha-helical transmembrane channel and transporter proteins play vital roles in a diverse range of essential biological processes and are crucial in facilitating the passage of ions and molecules across the lipid bilayer. However, the experimental difficulties associated with obtaining high quality crystals has led to their significant under-representation in structural databases. Computational methods that can identify structural features from sequence alone are therefore of high importance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We present a method capable of automatically identifying pore-lining regions in transmembrane proteins from sequence information alone, which can then be used to determine the pore stoichiometry. By labelling pore-lining residues in crystal structures using geometric criteria, we have trained a support vector machine classifier to predict the likelihood of a transmembrane helix being involved in pore formation. Results from testing this approach under stringent cross-validation indicate that prediction accuracy of 72{\%} is possible, while a support vector regression model is able to predict the number of subunits participating in the pore with 62{\%} accuracy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first tool capable of identifying pore-lining regions in proteins and we present the results of applying it to a data set of sequences with available crystal structures. Our method provides a way to characterise pores in transmembrane proteins and may even provide a starting point for discovering novel routes of therapeutic intervention in a number of important diseases.

 abstract = {Fast transverse relaxation of 1H, 15N, and 13C by dipole-dipole coupling (DD) and chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) modulated by rotational molecular motions has a dominant impact on the size limit for biomacromolecular structures that can be studied by NMR spectroscopy in solution. Transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) is an approach for suppression of transverse relaxation in multidimensional NMR experiments, which is based on constructive use of interference between DD coupling and CSA. For example, a TROSY-type two-dimensional 1H,15N-correlation experiment with a uniformly 15N-labeled protein in a DNA complex of molecular mass 17 kDa at a 1H frequency of 750 MHz showed that 15N relaxation during 15N chemical shift evolution and 1HN relaxation during signal acquisition both are significantly reduced by mutual compensation of the DD and CSA interactions. The reduction of the linewidths when compared with a conventional two-dimensional 1H,15N-correlation experiment was 60{\%} and 40{\%}, respectively, and the residual linewidths were 5 Hz for 15N and 15 Hz for 1HN at 4 degrees C. Because the ratio of the DD and CSA relaxation rates is nearly independent of the molecular size, a similar percentagewise reduction of the overall transverse relaxation rates is expected for larger proteins. For a 15N-labeled protein of 150 kDa at 750 MHz and 20 degrees C one predicts residual linewidths of 10 Hz for 15N and 45 Hz for 1HN, and for the corresponding uniformly 15N,2H-labeled protein the residual linewidths are predicted to be smaller than 5 Hz and 15 Hz, respectively. The TROSY principle should benefit a variety of multidimensional solution NMR experiments, especially with future use of yet somewhat higher polarizing magnetic fields than are presently available, and thus largely eliminate one of the key factors that limit work with larger molecules.},[m

We determined the structure of rhodopsin from diffraction data extending to 2.8 angstroms resolution. The highly organized structure in the extracellular region, including a conserved disulfide bridge, forms a basis for the arrangement of the seven-helix transmembrane motif. The ground-state chromophore, 11-cis-retinal, holds the transmembrane region of the protein in the inactive conformation. Interactions of the chromophore with a cluster of key residues determine the wavelength of the maximum absorption. Changes in these interactions among rhodopsins facilitate color discrimination.

In vitro studies such as crystallization are reliant on the successful solubilization or reconstitution of membrane proteins, which generally involves the careful selection of solubilizing detergents and mixed lipid/detergent systems. This review will concentrate on the methods currently available for efficient reconstitution and solubilization of membrane proteins through the use of detergent micelles, mixed lipid/detergent micelles and bicelles or liposomes. We focus on the relevant molecular properties of the detergents and lipids that aid understanding of these processes. A significant barrier to membrane protein research is retaining the stability and function of the protein during solubilization, reconstitution and crystallization. We highlight some of the lessons learnt from studies of membrane protein folding in vitro and give an overview of the role that lipids can play in stabilizing the proteins.},[m

 abstract = {Beta-barrel membrane proteins in Gram-negative bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts are assembled by highly conserved multi-protein complexes. The mechanism by which these molecular machines fold and insert their substrates is poorly understood. It has not been possible to dissect the folding and insertion pathway because the process has not been reproduced in a biochemical system. We purified the components that fold and insert Escherichia coli outer membrane proteins and reconstituted beta-barrel protein assembly in proteoliposomes using the enzymatic activity of a protein substrate to report on its folding state. The assembly of this protein occurred without an energy source but required a soluble chaperone in addition to the multi-protein assembly complex.},[m

 abstract = {The X-ray analysis of cholesteryl iodide is an example of the use that can be made of the presence of a heavy atom, here iodine, in working out the structure of an organic molecule containing a number of asymmetric centres. The method of analysis employed has been to calculate the electron density within the unit cell, using the observed F values and, at first, phase angles derived from the contributions of the iodine atoms alone. The electron density pattern so deduced necessarily has a centre of symmetry, since the positions of the two iodine atoms in the unit cell are related to one another by a centre of symmetry. It therefore shows, somewhat approximately, the positions of all the atoms in the molecule superimposed on those of a spurious mirror image molecule. Selection of the atomic positions belonging to one molecule was made through a consideration of normal carbon-carbon bond lengths and valency angles. The analysis was greatly assisted by the comparatively simple crystallographic character of the compound. Cholesteryl iodide crystallizes in two forms, A and B , of closely related crystal structure, both monoclinic, P 21, with n = 2. Fourier projections on (010) were derived for both forms and show clearly the outlines of the sterol molecules and their general arrangement. The resolution of the atomic positions is best in the case of B and three-dimensional analysis was therefore attempted on this form only. The crystal structure derived confirms the general view of sterol crystallography put forward by Bernal and also the present accepted chemical structure of the sterol skeleton. The accuracy with which the positions of the individual atoms are fixed is not great, but it appears sufficient to establish their mode of linking and to provide new evidence on their stereochemical relations.},[m

The first structures, determined 20 years ago, were those of naturally abundant proteins with limited conformational variability, and each membrane protein structure determined was a major landmark. With the advent of complete genome sequences and efficient expression systems, there has been an explosion in the rate of membrane protein structure determination, with many classes represented. New structures are published every month and more than 150 unique membrane protein structures have been determined.

 abstract = {A fluid mosaic model is presented for the gross organization and structure of the proteins and lipids of biological membranes. The model is consistent with the restrictions imposed by thermodynamics. In this model, the proteins that are integral to the membrane are a heterogeneous set of globular molecules, each arranged in an amphipathic structure, that is, with the ionic and highly polar groups protruding from the membrane into the aqueous phase, and the nonpolar groups largely buried in the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. These globular molecules are partially embedded in a matrix of phospholipid. The bulk of the phospholipid is organized as a discontinuous, fluid bilayer, although a small fraction of the lipid may interact specifically with the membrane proteins. The fluid mosaic structure is therefore formally analogous to a two-dimensional oriented solution of integral proteins (or lipoproteins) in the viscous phospholipid bilayer solvent. Recent experiments with a wide variety of techniqes and several different membrane systems are described, all of which abet consistent with, and add much detail to, the fluid mosaic model. It therefore seems appropriate to suggest possible mechanisms for various membrane functions and membrane-mediated phenomena in the light of the model. As examples, experimentally testable mechanisms are suggested for cell surface changes in malignant transformation, and for cooperative effects exhibited in the interactions of membranes with some specific ligands. Note added in proof: Since this article was written, we have obtained electron microscopic evidence (69) that the concanavalin A binding sites on the membranes of SV40 virus-transformed mouse fibroblasts (3T3 cells) are more clustered than the sites on the membranes of normal cells, as predicted by the hypothesis represented in Fig. 7B. T-here has also appeared a study by Taylor et al. (70) showing the remarkable effects produced on lymphocytes by the addition of antibodies directed to their surface immunoglobulin molecules. The antibodies induce a redistribution and pinocytosis of these surface immunoglobulins, so that within about 30 minutes at 37 degrees C the surface immunoglobulins are completely swept out of the membrane. These effects do not occur, however, if the bivalent antibodies are replaced by their univalent Fab fragments or if the antibody experiments are carried out at 0 degrees C instead of 37 degrees C. These and related results strongly indicate that the bivalent antibodies produce an aggregation of the surface immunoglobulin molecules in the plane of the membrane, which can occur only if the immunoglobulin molecules are free to diffuse in the membrane. This aggregation then appears to trigger off the pinocytosis of the membrane components by some unknown mechanism. Such membrane transformations may be of crucial importance in the induction of an antibody response to an antigen, as well as iv other processes of cell differentiation.},[m

Co-expression of a housefly NADPH P450 reductase substantially increases the ability of this P450 to hydroxylate trans-cinnamic acid, its natural phenylpropanoid substrate. For development of high-throughput P450 substrate profiling procedures, membrane proteins derived from cells overexpressing CYP73A5 and/or NADPH P450 reductase were incorporated into soluble His6-tagged nanoscale lipid bilayers (Nanodiscs) using a simple self-assembly process. Biochemical characterizations of nickel affinity-purified and size-fractionated Nanodiscs indicate that CYP73A5 protein assembled into Nanodiscs in the absence of NADPH P450 reductase maintains its ability to bind its t-cinnamic acid substrate. CYP73A5 protein co-assembled with P450 reductase into Nanodiscs hydroxylates t-cinnamic acid using reduced pyridine nucleotide as an electron source. These data indicate that baculovirus-expressed P450s assembled in Nanodiscs can be used to define the chemical binding profiles and enzymatic activities of these monooxygenases.},[m

Nevertheless, one can increase the probability of successful crystallization by precrystallization screening, a process by which one analyzes the monodispersity and stability of the protein-detergent complex. Traditionally, this has required microgram to milligram quantities of purified protein and a concomitant investment of time and resources. Here, we describe a rapid and efficient precrystallization screening strategy in which the target protein is covalently fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the resulting unpurified protein is analyzed by fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography (FSEC). This strategy requires only nanogram quantities of unpurified protein and allows one to evaluate localization and expression level, the degree of monodispersity, and the approximate molecular mass. We show the application of this precrystallization screening to four membrane proteins derived from prokaryotic or eukaryotic organisms.},[m

 abstract = {YidC of Echerichia coli, a member of the conserved Alb3/Oxa1/YidC family, is postulated to be important for biogenesis of membrane proteins. Here, we use as a model the lactose permease (LacY), a membrane transport protein with a known three-dimensional structure, to determine whether YidC plays a role in polytopic membrane protein insertion and/or folding. Experiments in vivo and with an in vitro transcription/translation/insertion system demonstrate that YidC is not necessary for insertion per se, but plays an important role in folding of LacY. By using the in vitro system and two monoclonal antibodies directed against conformational epitopes, LacY is shown to bind the antibodies poorly in YidC-depleted membranes. Moreover, LacY also folds improperly in proteoliposomes prepared without YidC. However, when the proteoliposomes are supplemented with purified YidC, LacY folds correctly. The results indicate that YidC plays a primary role in folding of LacY into its final tertiary conformation via an interaction that likely occurs transiently during insertion into the lipid phase of the membrane.},[m

A majority of these mutations affect folding or trafficking, rather than specifically affecting protein function. Many disease-linked mutations occur in integral membrane proteins, a class of proteins about whose folding we know very little. We examine the phenomenon of disease-linked misassembly of membrane proteins and describe model systems currently being used to study the delicate balance between proper folding and misassembly. We review a mechanism by which cells recognize membrane proteins with a high potential to misfold before they actually do, and which targets these culprits for degradation. Serious disease phenotypes can result from loss of protein function and from misfolded proteins that the cells cannot degrade, leading to accumulation of toxic aggregates. Misassembly may be averted by small-molecule drugs that bind and stab...},[m

 abstract = {Over 200 disease-causing mutations have been identified in the NPC1 gene. The most prevalent mutation, NPC1(I1061T), is predicted to lie within the cysteine-rich luminal domain and is associated with the classic juvenile-onset phenotype of Niemann-Pick type C disease. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism by which the NPC1(I1061T) mutation causes disease, we examined expression of the mutant protein in human fibroblasts homozygous for the NPC1(I1061T) mutation. Despite similar NPC1 mRNA levels between wild type and NPC1(I1061T) fibroblasts, NPC1 protein levels are decreased by 85{\%} in NPC1(I1061T) cells. Metabolic labeling studies demonstrate that unlike wild type protein, which undergoes a glycosylation pattern shift from Endo H-sensitive to Endo H-resistant species, NPC1(I1061T) protein remains almost exclusively Endo H-sensitive and exhibits a reduced half-life (t((1/2)) 6.5 h) versus wild type Endo H-resistant species (t((1/2)) 42 h). Treatment with chemical chaperones, growth at permissive temperature, or inhibition of proteasomal degradation increases NPC1(I1061T) protein levels, indicating that the mutant protein is likely targeted for endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) due to protein misfolding. Overexpression of NPC1(I1061T) in NPC1-deficient cells results in late endosomal localization of the mutant protein and complementation of the NPC mutant phenotype, likely due to a small proportion of the nascent NPC1(I1061T) protein that is able to fold correctly and escape the endoplasmic reticulum quality control checkpoints. Our findings provide the first description of an endoplasmic reticulum trafficking defect as a mechanism for human NPC disease, shedding light on the mechanism by which the NPC1(I1061T) mutation causes disease and suggesting novel approaches to treat NPC disease caused by the NPC1(I1061T) mutation.},[m

 abstract = {The mechanism of chloride transport by airway epithelia has been of substantial interest because airway and sweat gland-duct epithelia are chloride-impermeable in cystic fibrosis. The decreased chloride permeability prevents normal secretion by the airway epithelium, thereby interfering with mucociliary clearance and contributing to the morbidity and mortality of the disease. Because chloride secretion depends on and is regulated by chloride conductance in the apical cell membrane, the patch-clamp technique was used to directly examine single-channel currents in primary cultures of human tracheal epithelium. The cells contained an anion-selective channel that was not strongly voltage-gated or regulated by calcium in cell-free patches. The channel was also blocked by analogs of carboxylic acid that decrease apical chloride conductance in intact epithelia. When attached to the cell, the channel was activated by isoproterenol, although the channel was also observed to open spontaneously. However, in some cases, the channel was only observed after the patch was excised from the cell. These results suggest that this channel is responsible for the apical chloride conductance in airway epithelia.},[m

Features in transmembrane domains such as charged residues in ion channels are often functionally important, but could pose a challenge during cotranslational membrane insertion and folding. Our systematic proteomic approaches in both yeast and human cells revealed that the ER membrane protein complex (EMC) binds to and promotes the biogenesis of a range of multipass transmembrane proteins, with a particular enrichment for transporters. Proximity-specific ribosome profiling demonstrates that the EMC engages clients cotranslationally and immediately following clusters of TMDs enriched for charged residues. The EMC can remain associated after completion of translation, which both protects clients from premature degradation and allows recruitment of substrate-specific and general chaperones. Thus, the EMC broadly enables the biogenesis of multipass transmembrane proteins containing destabilizing features, thereby mitigating the trade-off between function and stability.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},[m

 abstract = {Escherichia coli preprotein translocase contains a membrane-embedded trimeric complex of SecY, SecE and SecG (SecYEG) and the peripheral SecA protein. SecYE is the conserved functional 'core' of the SecYEG complex. Although sufficient to provide sites for high-affinity binding and membrane insertion of SecA, and for its activation as a preprotein-dependent ATPase, SecYE has only very low capacity to support translocation. The proteins encoded by the secD operon--SecD, SecF and YajC--also form an integral membrane heterotrimeric complex (SecDFyajC). Physical and functional studies show that these two trimeric complexes are associated to form SecYEGDFyajC, the hexameric integral membrane domain of the preprotein translocase 'holoenzyme'. Either SecG or SecDFyajC can support the translocation activity of SecYE by facilitating the ATP-driven cycle of SecA membrane insertion and de-insertion at different stages of the translocation reaction. Our findings show that each of the prokaryote-specific subunits (SecA, SecG and SecDFyajC) function together to promote preprotein movement at the SecYE core of the translocase.},[m

We now show that a secY mutation, which compromises a functional SecY-SecA interaction, does not impair the SRP-mediated integration of polytopic inner membrane proteins. Furthermore, under conditions in which the translocation of secretory proteins is strictly dependent on SecG for assisting SecA, the absence of SecG still allows polytopic membrane proteins to integrate at the wild-type level. These results indicate that SRP-dependent integration and SecA/SecB-mediated translocation do not only represent two independent protein delivery systems, but also remain mechanistically distinct processes even at the level of the membrane where they engage different domains of SecY and different components of the translocon. In addition, the experimental setup used here enabled us to demonstrate that SRP-dependent integration of a multispanning protein into membrane vesicles leads to a biologically active enzyme.},[m

A truncated preprotein competes with the physiological full-length substrate and primes the protein-channel complex for transport. We have employed electron cryomicroscopy of two-dimensional crystals to determine the structure of the complex unlocked by the preprotein. Its visualization in the native environment of the membrane preserves the active arrangement of SecYEG dimers, in which only one of the two channels is occupied by the polypeptide substrate. The signal sequence could be identified along with the corresponding conformational changes in SecY, including relocation of transmembrane segments 2b and 7 as well as the plug, which presumably then promote channel opening.

Although the interaction between the bacterial SecYEG translocon and YidC has been observed in multiple studies, it is still unknown which domains of YidC are in contact with the SecYEG translocon. By in vivo and in vitro site-directed and para-formaldehyde cross-linking we identified the auxiliary transmembrane domain 1 of E. coli YidC as a major contact site for SecY and SecG. Additional SecY contacts were observed for the tightly packed globular domain and the C1 loop of YidC, which reveals that the hydrophilic cavity of YidC faces the lateral gate of SecY. Surprisingly, YidC-SecYEG contacts were only observed when YidC and SecYEG were present at about stoichiometric concentrations, suggesting that the YidC-SecYEG contact in vivo is either very transient or only observed for a very small SecYEG sub-population. This is different for the YidC-SRP and YidC-FtsY interaction, which involves the C1 loop of YidC and is efficiently observed even at sub-stoichiometric concentrations of SRP/FtsY. In summary, our data provide a first detailed view on how YidC interacts with the SecYEG translocon and the SRP-targeting machinery.},[m

 abstract = {Amino-terminal signal peptides (SPs) are short regions that guide the targeting of secretory proteins to the correct subcellular compartments in the cell. They are cleaved off upon the passenger protein reaching its destination. The explosive growth in sequencing technologies has led to the deposition of vast numbers of protein sequences necessitating rapid functional annotation techniques, with subcellular localization being a key feature. Of the myriad software prediction tools developed to automate the task of assigning the SP cleavage site of these new sequences, we review here, the performance and reliability of commonly used SP prediction tools. The available signal peptide data has been manually curated and organized into three datasets representing eukaryotes, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. These datasets are used to evaluate thirteen prediction tools that are publicly available. SignalP (both the HMM and ANN versions) maintains consistency and achieves the best overall accuracy in all three benchmarking experiments, ranging from 0.872 to 0.914 although other prediction tools are narrowing the performance gap. The majority of the tools evaluated in this study encounter no difficulty in discriminating between secretory and non-secretory proteins. The challenge clearly remains with pinpointing the correct SP cleavage site. The composite scoring schemes employed by SignalP may help to explain its accuracy. Prediction task is divided into a number of separate steps, thus allowing each score to tackle a particular aspect of the prediction.},[m

 abstract = {Beta-barrel membrane proteins occur in the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. The membrane-spanning sequences of $\beta$-barrel membrane proteins are less hydrophobic than those of $\alpha$-helical membrane proteins, which is probably the main reason why completely different folding and membrane assembly pathways have evolved for these two classes of membrane proteins. Some $\beta$-barrel membrane proteins can be spontaneously refolded into lipid bilayer model membranes in vitro. They may also have this ability in vivo although lipid and protein chaperones likely assist with their assembly in appropriate target membranes. This review summarizes recent work on the thermodynamic stability and the mechanism of membrane insertion of $\beta$-barrel membrane proteins in lipid model and biological membranes. How lipid compositions affect folding and assembly of $\beta$-barrel membrane proteins is also reviewed. The stability of these proteins in membranes is not as large as previously thought ({\textless}10 kcal/mol) and is modulated by elastic forces of the lipid bilayer. Detailed kinetic studies indicate that $\beta$-barrel membrane proteins fold in distinct steps with several intermediates that can be characterized in vitro. Formation of the barrel is synchronized with membrane insertion and all $\beta$-hairpins insert simultaneously in a concerted pathway.},[m

The $\beta$-barrel assembly machinery complex is required for OMP biogenesis. Crystal structures and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the central and essential component, BamA, suggest a mechanism involving lateral opening of its barrel domain. MD simulations reported here reveal an additional feature of BamA: a substrate exit pore positioned above the lateral opening site. Disulfide crosslinks that prevent lateral opening and exit pore formation result in a loss of BamA function, which can be fully rescued by the reductant tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. These data provide strong evidence that lateral opening and exit pore formation are required for BamA function.},[m

 abstract = {The periplasmic chaperones Skp, SurA, and DegP are implicated in the biogenesis of outer membrane proteins (OMPs) in Escherichia coli. Here, we investigated whether these chaperones exert similar functions in Neisseria meningitidis. Although N. meningitidis does not contain a homolog of the protease/chaperone DegP, it does possess a homolog of another E. coli protein, DegQ, which can functionally replace DegP when overproduced. Hence, we examined whether in N. meningitidis, DegQ acts as a functional homolog of DegP. Single skp, surA, and degQ mutants were easily obtained, showing that none of these chaperones is essential in N. meningitidis. Furthermore, all combinations of double mutants were generated and no synthetic lethality was observed. The absence of SurA or DegQ did not affect OMP biogenesis. In contrast, the absence of Skp resulted in severely lower levels of the porins PorA and PorB but not of other OMPs. These decreased levels were not due to proteolytic activity of DegQ, since porin levels remained low in a skp degQ double mutant, indicating that neisserial DegQ is not a functional homolog of E. coli DegP. The absence of Skp resulted in lower expression of the porB gene, as shown by using a P(porB)-lacZ fusion. We found no cross-species complementation when Skp of E. coli or N. meningitidis was heterologously expressed in skp mutants, indicating that Skp functions in a species-specific manner. Our results demonstrate an important role for Skp but not for SurA or DegQ in OMP biogenesis in N. meningitidis.},[m

 abstract = {Many proteins require enzymatic assistance in order to achieve a functional conformation. One rate-limiting step in protein folding is the cis-trans isomerization of prolyl residues, a reaction catalyzed by prolyl isomerases. SurA, a periplasmic protein of Escherichia coli, has sequence similarity with the prolyl isomerase parvulin. We tested whether SurA was involved in folding periplasmic and outer membrane proteins by using trypsin sensitivity as an assay for protein conformation. We determined that the efficient folding of three outer membrane proteins (OmpA, OmpF, and LamB) requires SurA in vivo, while the folding of four periplasmic proteins was independent of SurA. We conclude that SurA assists in the folding of certain secreted proteins.},[m

 abstract = {The vast majority of outer membrane (OM) proteins in Gram-negative bacteria belongs to the class of membrane-embedded $\beta$-barrel proteins. Besides Gram-negative bacteria, the presence of $\beta$-barrel proteins is restricted to the OM of the eukaryotic organelles mitochondria and chloroplasts that were derived from prokaryotic ancestors. The assembly of these proteins into the corresponding OM is in each case facilitated by a dedicated protein complex that contains a highly conserved central $\beta$-barrel protein termed BamA/YaeT/Omp85 in Gram-negative bacteria and Tob55/Sam50 in mitochondria. However, little is known about the exact mechanism by which these complexes mediate the integration of $\beta$-barrel precursors into the lipid bilayer. Interestingly, previous studies showed that during evolution, these complexes retained the ability to functionally assemble $\beta$-barrel proteins from different origins. In this review we summarize the current knowledge on the biogenesis pathway of $\beta$-barrel proteins in Gram-negative bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts and focus on the commonalities and divergences that evolved between the different $\beta$-barrel assembly machineries.},[m

However, recent predictions suggest that many transmembrane helices (TMHs) in multispanning membrane proteins are not sufficiently hydrophobic to be recognized as such by the translocon. In this study, we have screened 16 marginally hydrophobic TMHs from membrane proteins of known three-dimensional structure. Indeed, most of these TMHs do not insert efficiently into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by themselves. To test if loops or TMHs immediately upstream or downstream of a marginally hydrophobic helix might influence the insertion efficiency, insertion of marginally hydrophobic helices was also studied in the presence of their neighboring loops and helices. The results show that flanking loops and nearest-neighbor TMHs are sufficient to ensure the insertion of many marginally hydrophobic helices. However, for at least two of the marginally hydrophobic helices, the local interactions are not enough, indicating that post-insertional rearrangements are involved in the folding of these proteins.},[m

 abstract = {When secY is overexpressed over secE or secE is underexpressed, a fraction of SecY protein is rapidly degraded in vivo. This proteolysis was unaffected in previously described protease-defective mutants examined. We found, however, that some mutations in ftsH, encoding a membrane protein that belongs to the AAA (ATPase associated with a variety of cellular activities) family, stabilized oversynthesized SecY. This stabilization was due to a loss of FtsH function, and overproduction of the wild-type FtsH protein accelerated the degradation. The ftsH mutations also suppressed, by alleviating proteolysis of an altered form of SecY, the temperature sensitivity of the secY24 mutation, which alters SecY such that its interaction with SecE is weakened and it is destabilized at 42 degrees C. We were able to isolate a number of additional mutants with decreased ftsH expression or with an altered form of FtsH using selection/screening based on suppression of secY24 and stabilization of oversynthesized SecY. These results indicate that FtsH is required for degradation of SecY. Overproduction of SecY in the ftsH mutant cells proved to deleteriously affect cell growth and protein export, suggesting that elimination of uncomplexed SecY is important for optimum protein translocation and for the integrity of the membrane. The primary role of FtsH is discussed in light of the quite pleiotropic mutational effects, which now include stabilization of uncomplexed SecY.},[m

This study evaluates the plug hypothesis using cysteine crosslink experiments in combination with various allelic forms of the Sec complex. The results demonstrate that the SecY plug domain moves away from the center of the channel toward SecE during polypeptide translocation, and further show that the translocation-enhancing prlA3 mutation and SecG subunit change the properties of channel gating. Locking the plug in the open state preactivates the Sec complex, and a super-active translocase can be created when combined with the prlA4 mutation located in the pore of the channel. Dimerization of the Sec complex, which is essential for translocase activity, relocates the plug toward the open position. We propose that oligomerization may result in SecYEG cooperative interactions important to prime the translocon function.},[m

(i) Formaldehyde cross- linking of translocase reveals cross-links between SecY, SecE and SecG, but not higher order oligomers. (ii) Cross-linking of membranes containing unmodified SecE and hemagglutinin-tagged SecE (SecE(HA)) reveals cross-links between SecY and SecE and between SecY and SecE(HA). However, anti-HA immunoprecipitates contain neither untagged SecE nor SecY cross-linked to SecE. (iii) Membranes containing similar amounts of SecE and SecE(HA) were saturated with translocation intermediate (I(29)) and detergent solubilized. Anti-HA immunoprecipitation of I(29) required SecYE(HA)G and SecA, yet untagged SecE was not present in this translocation complex. Likewise, anti-HA immunoprecipitates of membranes containing equal amounts of SecY and SecY(HA) were found to contain SecY(HA) but not SecY. Both immunoprecipitates contain more moles of I(29) than of the untagged subunit, again suggesting that translocation intermediates are not engaged with multiple copies of SecYEG. These studies suggest that the active form of preprotein translocase is monomeric SecYEG.},[m

 abstract = {We have identified all homologues in the current databases of the ubiquitous protein constituents of the general secretory (Sec) pathway. These prokaryotic/eukaryotic proteins include (1) SecY/Sec61$\alpha$, (2) SecE/Sec61$\gamma$, (3) SecG/Sec61$\beta$, (4) Ffh/SRP54 and (5) FtsY/SRP receptor subunit-$\alpha$. Phylogenetic and sequence analyses lead to major conclusions concerning (1) the ubiquity of these proteins in living organisms, (2) the topological uniformity of some but not other Sec constituents, (3) the orthologous nature of almost all of them, (4) a total lack of paralogues in almost all organisms for which complete genome sequences are available, (5) the occurrence of two or even three paralogues in a few bacteria, plants, and yeast, depending on the Sec constituent, and (6) a tremendous degree of sequence divergence in bacteria compared with that in archaea or eukaryotes. The phylogenetic analyses lead to the conclusion that with a few possible exceptions, the five families of Sec constituents analyzed generally underwent sequence divergence in parallel but at different characteristic rates. The results provide evolutionary insights as well as guides for future functional studies. Because every organism with a fully sequenced genome exhibits at least one orthologue of each of these Sec proteins, we conclude that all living organisms have relied on the Sec system as their primary protein secretory/membrane insertion system. Because most prokaryotes and many eukaryotes encode within their genomes only one of each constituent, we also conclude that strong evolutionary pressure has minimized gene duplication events leading to the establishment of Sec paralogues. Finally, the sequence diversity of bacterial proteins as compared with their archaeal and eukaryotic counterparts is in agreement with the suggestion that bacteria were the evolutionary predecessors of archaea and eukaryotes.},[m

 abstract = {The orientation of most single-spanning membrane proteins obeys the "positive-inside rule", i.e. the flanking region of the transmembrane segment that is more positively charged remains in the cytosol. These membrane proteins are integrated by the Sec61/SecY translocon, but how their orientation is achieved is unknown. We have screened for mutations in yeast Sec61p that alter the orientation of single-spanning membrane proteins. We identified a class of mutants that are less efficient in retaining the positively charged flanking region in the cytosol. Surprisingly, these mutations are located at many different sites in the Sec61/SecY molecule, and they do not only involve charged amino acid residues. All these mutants have a prl phenotype that so far have only been seen in bacteria; they allow proteins with defective signal sequences to be translocated, likely because the Sec61p channel opens more easily. A similar correlation between topology defects and prl phenotype was also seen with previously identified yeast Sec61 mutants. Our results suggest a model in which the regulated opening of the translocon is required for the faithful orientation of membrane proteins.},[m

The crystal structure of the SecY channel from M. jannaschii revealed a plug domain that appears to seal the channel in its closed state. However, the role of the plug remains unclear, particularly because plug deletion mutants in S. cerevisiae are functional. Here, we demonstrate that plug deletion mutants in E. coli SecY are also functional and even efficiently translocate proteins with defective or missing signal sequences. The crystal structures of equivalent plug deletions in SecY of M. jannaschii show that, although the overall structures are maintained, new plugs are formed. These lack many interactions that normally stabilize the closed channel, explaining why the channels can open for proteins with signal-sequence mutations. Our data show that the plug domain is required to maintain a closed state of the channel and suggest a mechanism for channel gating.},[m

For reference, we created an extended peptide that was used as a "molecular tape measure" of the ribosomal tunnel and determined that the functional length of the tunnel is 99-112 A. We demonstrate that the S6 segment forms a compact structure inside the ribosomal tunnel and that the N-terminal half of S6 compacts more than the C-terminal half of S6.

In the most dramatic cases, one bundle is fixed while the other, structurally divergent, bundle carries the substrate some 18 {\AA} across the membrane, which in this review is termed an elevator alternating-access mechanism.

A comparison between CCR5 and CXCR4 crystal structures, along with models of co-receptor-gp120-V3 complexes, suggests that different charge distributions and steric hindrances caused by residue substitutions may be major determinants of HIV-1 co-receptor selectivity.

Substantial improvement of the resolution limit to 2.2{\AA} has been achieved by new crystallization conditions, which also reduce significantly the probability of merohedral twinning in the crystals. The new structure completely resolves the polypeptide chain and provides further details of the chromophore binding site including the configuration about the C6–C7 single bond of the 11-cis-retinal Schiff base. Based on both an earlier structure and the new improved model of the protein, a theoretical study of the chromophore geometry has been carried out using combined quantum mechanics/force field molecular dynamics. The consistency between the experimental and calculated chromophore structures is found to be significantly improved for the 2.2{\AA} model, including the angle of the negatively twisted 6-s-cis-bond. Importantly, the new crystal structure refinement reveals significant negative pre-twist of the C11–C12 double bond and this is also supported by the theoretical calculation although the latter converges to a smaller value. Bond alternation along the unsaturated chain is significant, but weaker in the calculated structure than the one obtained from the X-ray data. Other differences between the experimental and theoretical structures in the chromophore binding site are discussed with respect to the unique spectral properties and excited state reactivity of the chromophore.},[m

 abstract = {The ideas that proteins might possess specific functions without being uniquely folded into rigid 3D-structures and that these floppy polypeptides might constitute a noticeable part of any given proteome would have been considered as a preposterous fiction 15 or even 10 years ago. The situation has changed recently, and the existence of functional yet intrinsically disordered proteins and regions has become accepted by a significant number of protein scientists. These fuzzy objects with fuzzy structures and fuzzy functions are among the most interesting and attractive targets for modern protein research. This review summarizes some of the major discoveries and breakthroughs in the field of intrinsic disorder by representing related concepts and definitions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {Membrane protein biogenesis requires the coordinated movement of hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TMD) from the cytosolic vestibule of the Sec61 channel into the lipid bilayer. Molecular insight into TMD integration has been hampered by the difficulty of characterizing intermediates during this intrinsically dynamic process. In this study, we show that cotransin, a substrate-selective Sec61 inhibitor, traps nascent TMDs in the cytosolic vestibule, permitting detailed interrogation of an early pre-integration intermediate. Site-specific crosslinking revealed the pre-integrated TMD docked to Sec61 near the cytosolic tip of the lateral gate. Escape from cotransin-arrest depends not only on cotransin concentration, but also on the biophysical properties of the TMD. Genetic selection of cotransin-resistant cancer cells uncovered multiple mutations clustered near the lumenal plug of Sec61$\alpha$, thus revealing cotransin's likely site of action. Our results suggest that TMD/lateral gate interactions facilitate TMD transfer into the membrane, a process that is allosterically modulated by cotransin binding to the plug.

Detergents are soluble amphiphiles and above a critical concentration and temperature form micelles of various sizes and shapes. Much of the recent progress in studying the insoluble amphiphiles is due to the formation of thermodynamically stable isotropic solutions of these compounds in the presence of detergents. This process, which is commonly denoted as ‘solubilization,', involves transformation of lamellar structures into mixed micelles. The information available to date on the solubilization of phospholipids, which constitute the lipid skeleton of biomembranes, by the common detergents is discussed in this review, both with respect to the kinetics of this process and the structure of the various phospholipid-detergent mixed micelles formed. It is hoped that this discussion will lead to somewhat more useful, although still necessarily fairly empirical, approaches to the solubilization of phospholipids by detergents.},[m

 abstract = {The lacY gene of Escherichia coli was cut into two approximately equal-size fragments with Afl II and subcloned individually or together under separate lac operator/promoters in plasmid pT7-5. Under these conditions, lac permease is expressed in two portions: (i) the N-terminal portion (the N terminus, the first six putative transmembrane helices, and most of putative loop 7) and (ii) the C-terminal portion (the last six putative transmembrane helices and the C terminus). Cells harboring pT7-5 encoding both fragments transport lactose at about 30{\%} the rate of cells expressing intact permease to a comparable steady-state level of accumulation. In contrast, cells expressing either half of the permease independently do not transport lactose. As judged by [35S]methionine labeling and immunoblotting, intact permease is completely absent from the membrane of cells expressing lacY fragments either individually or together. Thus, transport activity must result from an association between independently synthesized pieces of lac permease. When the gene fragments are expressed individually, the N-terminal portion of the permease is observed inconsistently, and the C-terminal portion is not observed. When the gene fragments are expressed together, polypeptides identified as the N- and C-terminal moieties of the permease are found in the membrane. It is concluded that the N- or C-terminal halves of lac permease are proteolyzed when synthesized independently and that association between the two complementing polypeptides leads to a more stable, catalytically active complex.},[m

 abstract = {The factors contributing to the establishment of the steady state Golgi pH (pH(G)) were studied in intact and permeabilized mammalian cells by fluorescence ratio imaging. Retrograde transport of the nontoxic B subunit of verotoxin 1 was used to deliver pH-sensitive probes to the Golgi complex. To evaluate whether counter-ion permeability limited the activity of the electrogenic V-ATPase, we determined the concentration of K(+) in the lumen of the Golgi using a null point titration method. The [K(+)] inside the Golgi was found to be close to that of the cytosol, and increasing its permeability had no effect on pH(G). Moreover, the capacity of the endogenous counter-ion permeability exceeded the rate of H(+) pumping, implying that the potential across the Golgi membrane is negligible and has little influence on pH(G). The V-ATPase does not reach thermodynamic equilibrium nor does it seem to be allosterically inactivated at the steady state pH(G). In fact, active H(+) pumping was detectable even below the resting pH(G). A steady state pH was attained when the rate of pumping was matched by the passive backflux of H(+) (equivalents) or "leak." The nature of this leak pathway was investigated in detail. Neither vesicular traffic nor H(+)/cation antiporters or symporters were found to contribute to the net loss of H(+) from the Golgi. Instead, the leak was sensitive to voltage changes and was inhibited by Zn(2+), resembling the H(+) conductive pathway of the plasma membrane. We conclude that a balance between an endogenous leak, which includes a conductive component, and the H(+) pump determines the pH at which the Golgi lumen attains a steady state.},[m

We conclude that, although TRC40 normally plays an important role in TA protein biogenesis, it is not essential, and speculate that alternative pathways for TA protein biogenesis, including those identified in this study, contribute to the redundancy of the TRC40 pathway.},[m

It has been suggested that this evolutionary transition was critically dependent on the movement of ATP synthesis from the cell surface to mitochondrial membranes and the resultant boost to the energetic capacity of eukaryotic cells. However, contrary to this hypothesis, numerous lines of evidence suggest that eukaryotes are no more bioenergetically efficient than prokaryotes. Thus, although the origin of the mitochondrion was a key event in evolutionary history, there is no reason to think membrane bioenergetics played a direct, causal role in the transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes and the subsequent explosive diversification of cellular and organismal complexity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},[m

 abstract = {We report here that the inward-rectifying potassium channels KAT1 and AKT2 were functionally expressed in K+ uptake-deficient Escherichia coli. Immunological assays showed that KAT1 was translocated into the cell membrane of E. coli. Functional assays suggested that KAT1 was inserted topologically correctly into the cell membrane. In control experiments, the inactive point mutation in KAT1, T256R, did not complement for K+ uptake in E. coli. The inward-rectifying K+ channels of plants share a common hydrophobic domain comprising at least six membrane-spanning segments (S1-S6). The finding that a K+ channel can be expressed in bacteria was further exploited to determine the KAT1 membrane topology by a gene fusion approach using the bacterial reporter enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, which is active only in the periplasm, and beta-galactosidase. The enzyme activity from the alkaline phosphatase and beta-galactosidase fusion plasmid showed that the widely predicted S1, S2, S5, and S6 segments were inserted into the membrane. Although the S3 segment in the alkaline phosphatase fusion protein could not function as an export signal, the replacement of a negatively charged residue inside S3 with a neutral amino acid resulted in an increase in alkaline phosphatase activity, which indicates that the alkaline phosphatase was translocated into the periplasm. For membrane translocation of S3, the neutralization of a negatively charged residue in S3 may be required presumably because of pairing with a positively charged residue of S4. These results revealed that KAT1 has the common six transmembrane-spanning membrane topology that has been predicted for the Shaker superfamily of voltage-dependent K+ channels. Furthermore, the functional complementation of a bacterial K+ uptake mutant in this study is shown to be an alternative expression system for plant K+ channel proteins and a potent tool for their topological analysis.},[m

 abstract = {Membrane-embedded voltage-sensor domains in voltage-dependent potassium channels (K(v) channels) contain an impressive number of charged residues. How can such highly charged protein domains be efficiently inserted into biological membranes? In the plant K(v) channel KAT1, the S2, S3, and S4 transmembrane helices insert cooperatively, because the S3, S4, and S3-S4 segments do not have any membrane insertion ability by themselves. Here we show that, in the Drosophila Shaker K(v) channel, which has a more hydrophobic S3 helix than KAT1, S3 can both insert into the membrane by itself and mediate the insertion of the S3-S4 segment in the absence of S2. An engineered KAT1 S3-S4 segment in which the hydrophobicity of S3 was increased or where S3 was replaced by Shaker S3 behaves as Shaker S3-S4. Electrostatic interactions among charged residues in S2, S3, and S4, including the salt bridges between E283 or E293 in S2 and R368 in S4, are required for fully efficient membrane insertion of the Shaker voltage-sensor domain. These results suggest that cooperative insertion of the voltage-sensor transmembrane helices is a property common to K(v) channels and that the degree of cooperativity depends on a balance between electrostatic and hydrophobic forces.},[m

 abstract = {Methods that predict the topology of helical membrane proteins are standard tools when analyzing any proteome. Therefore, it is important to improve the performance of such methods. Here we introduce a novel method, PRODIV-TMHMM, which is a profile-based hidden Markov model (HMM) that also incorporates the best features of earlier HMM methods. In our tests, PRODIV-TMHMM outperforms earlier methods both when evaluated on “low-resolution” topology data and on high-resolution 3D structures. The results presented here indicate that the topology could be correctly predicted for approximately two-thirds of all membrane proteins using PRODIV-TMHMM. The importance of evolutionary information for topology prediction is emphasized by the fact that compared with using single sequences, the performance of PRODIV-TMHMM (as well as two other methods) is increased by approximately 10 percentage units by the use of homologous sequences. On a more general level, we also show that HMM-based (or similar) methods perform superiorly to methods that focus mainly on identification of the membrane regions.},[m

 abstract = {Glucose stimulation of islet beta-cell insulin secretion is initiated by membrane depolarization and an elevation in intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) from a combination of influx through depolarization-activated Ca2+ channels and intracellular Ca2+ store release. Prevention of Ca2+ store refilling with thapsigargin produced a sustained depolarization, leading to enhanced Ca2+ influx and an elevation in [Ca2+]i in 12 mM glucose. Depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by external EGTA reduced [Ca2+]i and also caused a long-lasting depolarization. In single beta-cells, external EGTA activated an inward current, the voltage range and kinetic properties of which differed from those of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. A novel pathway thus exists in beta-cells by which depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores results in the activation of an inward current that, by inducing depolarization, facilitates Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The physiological relevance of this pathway in the control of beta-cell function is indicated by the stimulation of insulin secretion by thapsigargin.},[m

 abstract = {Proteins destined for the endomembrane system of eukaryotic cells are typically translocated into or across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and this process is normally closely coupled to protein synthesis. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that a significant proportion of proteins are targeted to and inserted into the ER membrane post-translationally, that is after their synthesis is complete. These proteins must be efficiently captured and delivered to the target membrane, and indeed a failure to do so may even disrupt proteostasis resulting in cellular dysfunction and disease. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms by which various protein precursors can be targeted to the ER and either inserted into or translocated across the membrane post-translationally.

Here, we found that known membrane insertion pathways fail to effectively engage tail-anchored membrane proteins with moderately hydrophobic transmembrane domains. These proteins are instead shielded in the cytosol by calmodulin. Dynamic release from calmodulin allowed sampling of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the conserved ER membrane protein complex (EMC) was shown to be essential for efficient insertion in vitro and in cells. Purified EMC in synthetic liposomes catalyzed insertion of its substrates in a reconstituted system.

 abstract = {Protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the first and decisive step in the biogenesis of most extracellular and many soluble organelle proteins in eukaryotic cells. It is mechanistically related to protein export from eubacteria and archaea and to the integration of newly synthesized membrane proteins into the ER membrane and the plasma membranes of eubacteria and archaea (with the exception of tail anchored membrane proteins). Typically, protein translocation into the ER involves cleavable amino terminal signal peptides in precursor proteins and sophisticated transport machinery components in the cytosol, the ER membrane, and the ER lumen. Depending on the hydrophobicity and/or overall amino acid content of the precursor protein, transport can occur co- or posttranslationally. The respective mechanism determines the requirements for certain cytosolic transport components. The two mechanisms merge at the level of the ER membrane, specifically, at the heterotrimeric Sec61 complex present in the membrane. The Sec61 complex provides a signal peptide recognition site and forms a polypeptide conducting channel. Apparently, the Sec61 complex is gated by various ligands, such as signal peptides of the transport substrates, ribosomes (in cotranslational transport), and the ER lumenal molecular chaperone, BiP. Binding of BiP to the incoming polypeptide contributes to efficiency and unidirectionality of transport. Recent insights into the structure of the Sec61 complex and the comparison of the transport mechanisms and machineries in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the human parasite Trypanosoma brucei, and mammals have various important mechanistic as well as potential medical implications.

We combined rapid auxin-induced SRP degradation with proximity-specific ribosome profiling to define SRP's in vivo function in yeast. Despite the classic view that SRP recognizes amino-terminal signal sequences, we show that SRP was generally essential for targeting transmembrane domains regardless of their position relative to the amino terminus. By contrast, many proteins containing cleavable amino-terminal signal peptides were efficiently cotranslationally targeted in SRP's absence. We also reveal an unanticipated consequence of SRP loss: Transcripts normally targeted to the ER were mistargeted to mitochondria, leading to mitochondrial defects. These results elucidate SRP's essential roles in maintaining the efficiency and specificity of protein targeting.},[m

 abstract = {Tail-anchored (TA) proteins are anchored to their corresponding membrane via a single transmembrane segment (TMS) at their C-terminus. In yeast, the targeting of TA proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can be mediated by the guided entry of TA proteins (GET) pathway, whereas it is not yet clear how mitochondrial TA proteins are targeted to their destination. It is widely observed that some mitochondrial outer membrane (OM) proteins are mistargeted to the ER when overexpressed or when their targeting signal is masked. However, the mechanism of this erroneous sorting is currently unknown. In this study, we demonstrate the involvement of the GET machinery in mistargeting of non-optimal mitochondrial OM proteins to the ER. These findings suggest that the GET machinery can, in principle, recognize and guide mitochondrial and non-canonical TA proteins. Hence, under normal conditions, an active mitochondrial targeting pathway must exist that dominates the kinetic competition against other pathways.},[m

 abstract = {The biogenesis of mitochondria requires the import of a large number of proteins from the cytosol [1, 2]. Although numerous studies have defined the proteinaceous machineries that mediate mitochondrial protein sorting, little is known about the role of lipids in mitochondrial protein import. Cardiolipin, the signature phospholipid of the mitochondrial inner membrane [3-5], affects the stability of many inner-membrane protein complexes [6-12]. Perturbation of cardiolipin metabolism leads to the X-linked cardioskeletal myopathy Barth syndrome [13-18]. We report that cardiolipin affects the preprotein translocases of the mitochondrial outer membrane. Cardiolipin mutants genetically interact with mutants of outer-membrane translocases. Mitochondria from cardiolipin yeast mutants, as well as Barth syndrome patients, are impaired in the biogenesis of outer-membrane proteins. Our findings reveal a new role for cardiolipin in protein sorting at the mitochondrial outer membrane and bear implications for the pathogenesis of Barth syndrome. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

GET (guided entry of tail-anchored proteins) and SND (SRP independent) are two such targeting pathways described in yeast. So far, no human SND component is functionally characterized. Here, we report hSnd2 as the first constituent of the human SND pathway able to support substrate-specific protein targeting to the ER. Similar to its yeast counterpart, hSnd2 is assumed to function as a membrane-bound receptor preferentially targeting precursors carrying C-terminal transmembrane domains. Our genetic and physical interaction studies show that hSnd2 is part of a complex network of targeting and translocation that is dynamically regulated. This article is protected by copyright.

Features in transmembrane domains such as charged residues in ion channels are often functionally important, but could pose a challenge during cotranslational membrane insertion and folding. Our systematic proteomic approaches in both yeast and human cells revealed that the ER membrane protein complex (EMC) binds to and promotes the biogenesis of a range of multipass transmembrane proteins, with a particular enrichment for transporters. Proximity-specific ribosome profiling demonstrates that the EMC engages clients cotranslationally and immediately following clusters of TMDs enriched for charged residues. The EMC can remain associated after completion of translation, which both protects clients from premature degradation and allows recruitment of substrate-specific and general chaperones. Thus, the EMC broadly enables the biogenesis of multipass transmembrane proteins containing destabilizing features, thereby mitigating the trade-off between function and stability.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},[m

Some TA proteins spontaneously insert into protein-free liposomes, yet target a specific organelle in vivo. Two spontaneously inserting cytochrome b5 forms, b5-ER and b5-RR, which differ only in the charge of the C-terminal region, target the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM), respectively. To bridge the gap between the cell-free and in cellula results, we analyzed targeting in digitonin-permeabilized adherent HeLa cells. In the absence of cytosol, the MOM was the destination of both b5 forms, whereas in cytosol the C-terminal negative charge of b5-ER determined targeting to the ER. Inhibition of the transmembrane recognition complex (TRC) pathway only partially reduced b5 targeting, while strongly affecting the classical TRC substrate synaptobrevin 2 (Syb2). To identify additional pathways, we tested a number of small inhibitors, and found that Eeyarestatin I (ESI) reduced insertion of b5-ER and of another spontaneously inserting TA protein, while not affecting Syb2. The effect was independent from the known targets of ESI, Sec61 and p97/VCP. Our results demonstrate that the MOM is the preferred destination of spontaneously inserting TA proteins, regardless of their C-terminal charge, and reveal a novel, substrate-specific ER-targeting pathway.},[m

 abstract = {LITAF (LPS-induced TNF-activating factor) is an endosome-associated integral membrane protein important for multivesicular body sorting. Several mutations in LITAF cause autosomal-dominant Charcot Marie Tooth disease type 1C. These mutations map to a highly conserved C-terminal region, termed the LITAF domain, which includes a 22 residue hydrophobic sequence and flanking cysteine-rich regions that contain peptide motifs found in zinc fingers. Although the LITAF domain is thought to be responsible for membrane integration, the membrane topology of LITAF has not been established. Here, we have investigated whether LITAF is a tail-anchored (TA) membrane-spanning protein or monotopic membrane protein. When translated in vitro, LITAF integrates poorly into ER-derived microsomes compared with Sec61$\beta$, a bona fide TA protein. Furthermore, introduction of N-linked glycosylation reporters shows that neither the N-terminal nor C-terminal domains of LITAF translocate into the ER lumen. Expression in cells of an LITAF construct containing C-terminal glycosylation sites confirms that LITAF is not a TA protein in cells. Finally, an immunofluorescence-based latency assay showed that both the N- and C-termini of LITAF are exposed to the cytoplasm. Recombinant LITAF contains 1 mol/mol zinc, while mutation of predicted zinc-binding residues disrupts LITAF membrane association. Hence, we conclude that LITAF is a monotopic membrane protein whose membrane integration is stabilised by a zinc finger. The related human protein, CDIP1 (cell death involved p53 target 1), displays identical membrane topology, suggesting that this mode of membrane integration is conserved in LITAF family proteins.},[m

 abstract = {MOTIVATION: Membrane domain prediction has recently been re-evaluated by several groups, suggesting that the accuracy of existing methods is still rather limited. In this work, we revisit this problem and propose novel methods for prediction of alpha-helical as well as beta-sheet transmembrane (TM) domains. The new approach is based on a compact representation of an amino acid residue and its environment, which consists of predicted solvent accessibility and secondary structure of each amino acid. A recently introduced method for solvent accessibility prediction trained on a set of soluble proteins is used here to indicate segments of residues that are predicted not to be accessible to water and, therefore, may be 'buried' in the membrane. While evolutionary profiles in the form of a multiple alignment are used to derive these simple 'structural profiles', they are not used explicitly for the membrane domain prediction and the overall number of parameters in the model is significantly reduced. This offers the possibility of a more reliable estimation of the free parameters in the model with a limited number of experimentally resolved membrane protein structures. RESULTS: Using cross-validated training on available sets of structurally resolved and non-redundant alpha and beta membrane proteins, we demonstrate that membrane domain prediction methods based on such a compact representation outperform approaches that utilize explicitly evolutionary profiles and multiple alignments. Moreover, using an external evaluation by the TMH Benchmark server we show that our final prediction protocol for the TM helix prediction is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods, achieving per-residue accuracy of approximately 89{\%} and per-segment accuracy of approximately 80{\%} on the set of high resolution structures used by the TMH Benchmark server. At the same time the observed rates of confusion with signal peptides and globular proteins are the lowest among the tested methods. The new method is available online at http://minnou.cchmc.org.},[m

Although the targeting of TA proteins to peroxisomes is dependent on PEX19, the mechanistic details of PEX19-dependent targeting and the signal that directs TA proteins to peroxisomes have remained elusive, particularly in mammals. The present study shows that PEX19 formed a complex with the peroxisomal TA protein PEX26 in the cytosol and translocated it directly to peroxisomes by interacting with the peroxisomal membrane protein PEX3. Unlike in yeast, the adenosine triphosphatase TRC40, which delivers TA proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum, was dispensable for the peroxisomal targeting of PEX26. Moreover, the basic amino acids within the luminal domain of PEX26 were essential for binding to PEX19 and thereby for peroxisomal targeting. Finally, our results suggest that a TMD that escapes capture by TRC40 and is followed by a highly basic luminal domain directs TA proteins to peroxisomes via the PEX19-dependent route.},[m

These experiments revealed that (i) C-TA proteins were imported to the MOM through a common pathway independent of the components of the preprotein translocase of the outer membrane, (ii) the C-TA protein-targeting signal functioned autonomously in the absence of cytoplasmic factors that specifically recognize the targeting signals and deliver the preproteins to the MOM, (iii) the function of a cytoplasmic chaperone was required if the cytoplasmic domains of the C-TA proteins assumed an import-incompetent conformation, and intriguingly, (iv) the MOM-targeting signal of Bak, in the context of the Bak molecule, required activation by the interaction of its cytoplasmic domain with VDAC2 before MOM targeting.},[m

 abstract = {Tail-anchored proteins form a distinct class of membrane proteins that are found in all intracellular membranes exposed to the cytosol. These proteins have a single membrane insertion sequence at their C-terminus and display a large N-terminal portion to the cytosol. Despite their importance for various cellular processes, the mechanisms by which these proteins are recognized at and inserted into their corresponding target membrane remained largely unclear. Here we address this issue and investigate the biogenesis of tail-anchored proteins residing in the mitochondrial outer membrane. To that goal we developed a highly specific assay to monitor the membrane insertion of the model tail-anchored protein Fis1. Using this assay, we show that in contrast to all other import pathways in yeast mitochondria, none of the import components at the outer membrane is involved in the insertion process of Fis1. Both the steady-state levels of Fis1 and its in vitro insertion into isolated mitochondria were unaffected when mitochondria mutated in known import factors were analyzed. Fis1 was inserted into lipid vesicles, and importantly, elevated ergosterol contents in these vesicles inhibited this insertion. Collectively, these results suggest that Fis1 is inserted into mitochondria in a novel pathway where the unique lipid composition of the mitochondrial outer membrane contributes to the selectivity of the process. Thus, this work demonstrates a novel role for lipids in the biogenesis of mitochondrial protein.},[m

By using the cell's endogenous sensor (the unfolded protein response), we identified several hundred yeast genes with roles in endoplasmic reticulum folding and systematically characterized their functional interdependencies by measuring unfolded protein response levels in double mutants. This strategy revealed multiple conserved factors critical for endoplasmic reticulum folding, including an intimate dependence on the later secretory pathway, a previously uncharacterized six-protein transmembrane complex, and a co-chaperone complex that delivers tail-anchored proteins to their membrane insertion machinery. The use of a quantitative reporter in a comprehensive screen followed by systematic analysis of genetic dependencies should be broadly applicable to functional dissection of complex cellular processes from yeast to human.},[m

We show here that newly synthesised RAMP4 and Sec61beta can accumulate in a cytosolic, soluble complex with the ATPase Asna1 before insertion into ER-derived membranes. Membrane insertion of these TA proteins is stimulated by ATP, sensitive to redox conditions and blocked by alkylation of SH groups by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). By contrast, membrane insertion of cytochrome b5 is not found to be mediated by Asna1, not stimulated by ATP and not affected by NEM or an oxidative environment.

Although these tail-anchored (TA) proteins serve numerous essential roles in cells, components of their targeting and insertion pathways have long remained elusive. Here we reveal a cytosolic TMD recognition complex (TRC) that targets TA proteins for insertion into the ER membrane. The highly conserved, 40 kDa ATPase subunit of TRC (which we termed TRC40) was identified as Asna-1. TRC40/Asna-1 interacts posttranslationally with TA proteins in a TMD-dependent manner for delivery to a proteinaceous receptor at the ER membrane. Subsequent release from TRC40/Asna-1 and insertion into the membrane depends on ATP hydrolysis. Consequently, an ATPase-deficient mutant of TRC40/Asna-1 dominantly inhibited TA protein insertion selectively without influencing other translocation pathways. Thus, TRC40/Asna-1 represents an integral component of a posttranslational pathway of membrane protein insertion whose targeting is mediated by TRC. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, until recently a subset of membrane proteins, those shorter than 100 amino acids, have almost completely evaded detection due to technical difficulties. These small membrane proteins (SMPs) have been underrepresented in most genomic and proteomic screens of both pro- and eukaryotic cells and hence, we know much less about their functions in both. Currently, through a combination of bioinformatics, ribosome profiling, and more sensitive proteomics, large numbers of SMPs are being identified and characterized. Herein we describe recent advances in identifying SMPs from genomic and proteomic datasets and describe examples where SMPs have been successfully characterized biochemically. Finally we give an overview of identified functions of SMPs and speculate on the possible roles SMPs play in the cell.},[m

Folding MPs is as useful from a practical point of view as it is thought-provoking from a theoretical one. Yet, this activity is considered as a high-risk, time-consuming endeavor, full of pitfalls, its path littered with the broken careers of graduate students sacrificed on the altar of a long shot that never paid off. In fact, a surprisingly high number of MPs have actually been folded or refolded in vitro. Analysis of the literature indicates (i) that the endeavor is not as desperate as it may seem, (ii) that techniques are diversifying and improving, and (iii) that many MPs do not need the cellular biosynthetic apparatus, nor even a membrane environment, to reach a functional 3D structure. A compilation, hopefully close to complete, is presented of MPs that have been (re)folded in vitro to-date, with the conditions of their synthesis, the denaturant(s) used, if any, and the (re)folding conditions, along with a few comments. The hope is that this analysis will encourage membrane protein biochemists to consider producing their target proteins in this way, help them decide about an experimental course, and stimulate the reflection about which environments favor membrane protein folding and why.},[m

This extremely prolonged association implicates the Sec61 complex in the regulation of the membrane integration process, and we use both in vitro and in vivo analyses to study this effect further. TM-segment retention depends on the association of the ribosome with the Sec61 complex, and complete lateral exit of the P2X2 TM segments was only induced by the artificial termination of translation. In the event of the premature release of P2X2 TM1 from the ER translocon, the truncated polypeptide fragment was to found aggregate in the ER membrane, suggesting a distinct physiological requirement for the delayed release of TM segments from the ER translocon site.},[m

Molecular insight into TMD integration has been hampered by the difficulty of characterizing intermediates during this intrinsically dynamic process. In this study, we show that cotransin, a substrate-selective Sec61 inhibitor, traps nascent TMDs in the cytosolic vestibule, permitting detailed interrogation of an early pre-integration intermediate. Site-specific crosslinking revealed the pre-integrated TMD docked to Sec61 near the cytosolic tip of the lateral gate. Escape from cotransin-arrest depends not only on cotransin concentration, but also on the biophysical properties of the TMD. Genetic selection of cotransin-resistant cancer cells uncovered multiple mutations clustered near the lumenal plug of Sec61$\alpha$, thus revealing cotransin's likely site of action. Our results suggest that TMD/lateral gate interactions facilitate TMD transfer into the membrane, a process that is allosterically modulated by cotransin binding to the plug.

Whereas single mutations in this motif impair recognition, we demonstrate that new arrest-inducing peptides can be created through remodeling of the SecM C terminus. We found that R163 is indispensable but that flanking residues that vary in number and position play an important secondary role in translation arrest. The observation that individual SecM variants showed a distinct pattern of crosslinking to ribosomal proteins suggests that each peptide adopts a unique conformation inside the tunnel. Based on the results, we propose that translation arrest occurs when the peptide conformation specified by flanking residues moves R163 into a precise intratunnel location. Our data indicate that translation arrest results from extensive communication between SecM and the tunnel and help to explain the striking diversity of arrest-inducing peptides found throughout nature. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies demonstrated that this regulation requires a translational pause within secM, whose duration regulates the accessibility of the secA Shine-Dalgarno sequence on secM secA mRNA. Here we provide evidence that translocon "pulling" of nascent SecM is what regulates the duration of the secM translational pause, and thus secA expression levels, thereby providing direct support for this model.},[m

 abstract = {Voltage-dependent ion channels control changes in ion permeability in response to membrane potential changes. The voltage sensor in channel proteins consists of the highly positively charged segment, S4, and the negatively charged segments, S2 and S3. The process involved in the integration of the protein into the membrane remains to be elucidated. In this study, we used in vitro translation and translocation experiments to evaluate interactions between residues in the voltage sensor of a hyperpolarization-activated potassium channel, KAT1, and their effect on the final topology in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. A D95V mutation in S2 showed less S3-S4 integration into the membrane, whereas a D105V mutation allowed S4 to be released into the ER lumen. These results indicate that Asp(95) assists in the membrane insertion of S3-S4 and that Asp(105) helps in preventing S4 from being releasing into the ER lumen. The charge reversal mutation, R171D, in S4 rescued the D105R mutation and prevented S4 release into the ER lumen. A series of constructs containing different C-terminal truncations of S4 showed that Arg(174) was required for correct integration of S3 and S4 into the membrane. Interactions between Asp(105) and Arg(171) and between negative residues in S2 or S3 and Arg(174) may be formed transiently during membrane integration. These data clarify the role of charged residues in S2, S3, and S4 and identify posttranslational electrostatic interactions between charged residues that are required to achieve the correct voltage sensor topology in the ER membrane.},[m

 abstract = {KAT1 is a member of the Shaker family of voltage-dependent K(+) channels, which has six transmembrane segments (called S1-S6), including an amphipathic S4 with several positively charged residues and a hydrophobic pore-forming region (called P) between S5 and S6. In this study, we systematically evaluated the function of individual and combined transmembrane segments of KAT1 to direct the final topology in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by in vitro translation and translocation experiments. The assay with single-transmembrane constructs showed that S1 possesses the type II signal-anchor function, whereas S2 has the stop-transfer function. The properties fit well with the results derived from combined insertion of S1 and S2. S3 and S4 failed to integrate into the membrane by themselves. The inserted glycosylation sequence at the S3-S4 loop neither prevented the translocation of S3 and S4 nor impaired the function of voltage-dependent K(+) transport regardless of the changed length of the S3-S4 loop. S3 and S4 are likely to be posttranslationally integrated into the membrane only when somewhat specific interaction occurs between them. S5 had the ability of translocation reinitiation, and S6 had a strong preference for N(exo)/C(cyt) orientation. The pore region resided outside because of its lack of its transmembrane-spanning property. According to their own topogenic function, combined constructs of S5-P-S6 conferred the membrane-pore-membrane topology. This finding supports the notion that a set of S5-P-S6 can be independently integrated into the membrane. The results in this study provide the fundamental topogenesis mechanism of transmembrane segments involving voltage sensor and pore region in KAT1.},[m

Membranes are known to have modulatory effects on GPCRs via specific lipid interactions. However, the mechanisms of such modulations in cell membranes and how they influence GPCR functions remain unclear. Here we report coarse-grained MD simulations on the Adenosine A2a receptor embedded in an in vivo mimetic membrane model comprised of 10 different lipid species. Three conformational states of the receptor, i.e. the inactive state, the active state, and the active state with a mini-GS protein bound were simulated to study the impact of protein-lipid interactions on the receptor activation. The simulations revealed three specific lipids (GM3, cholesterol and PIP2) that form stable and preferential interactions with the receptor, differentiating these from bulk lipids such as PS, PE and PC. In total, nine specific lipid-binding sites were revealed. The strength of lipid interaction with these sites depends on the conformational state of the receptor, suggesting that these lipids may regulate the conformational dynamics of the receptor. In particular, we revealed a dual role of PIP2 in promoting A2aR activation, which involves stabilization of both the characteristic outward tilt of helix TM6 within receptor and also the association of A2aR and mini-Gs when the activated complex forms. Structural comparisons suggested that PIP2 may facilitate G$\alpha$ activation. Our results reveal likely allosteric effects of bound lipids in regulating the functional behaviour of GPCRs, providing a springboard for design of allosteric modulators of these biomedically important receptors.},[m

Several studies indicate that GPCRs control many aspects of cancer progression including tumor growth, invasion, migration, survival and metastasis. While it is known that GPCR activity can be altered in cancer through aberrant overexpression, gain-of-function activating mutations, and increased production and secretion of agonists, the precise mechanisms of how GPCRs contribute to cancer progression remains elusive. Protease-activated receptors (PARs) are a unique class of GPCRs implicated in cancer. PARs are a subfamily of GPCRs comprised of four members that are irreversibly activated by proteolytic cleavage induced by various proteases generated in the tumor microenvironment. Given the unusual proteolytic irreversible activation of PARs, expression of receptors at the cell surface is a key feature that influences signaling responses and is exquisitely controlled by endocytic adaptor proteins. Here, we discuss new survey data from the Cancer Genome Atlas and the Genotype-Tissue Expression projects analysis of expression of all PAR family member expression in human tumor samples as well as the role and function of the endocytic sorting machinery that controls PAR expression and signaling of PARs in normal cells and in cancer.},[m

Numerous lines of evidence now associate GPCRs and their downstream signaling targets in cancer growth and development. Indeed, GPCRs control many features of tumorigenesis, including immune cell-mediated functions, proliferation, invasion and survival at the secondary site. Technological advances have further substantiated GPCR modifications in human tumors. Among these are point mutations, gene overexpression, GPCR silencing by promoter methylation and the number of gene copies. At this point, it is imperative to elucidate specific signaling pathways of "cancer driver" GPCRs. Emerging data on GPCR biology point to functional selectivity and "biased agonism"; hence, there is a diminishing enthusiasm for the concept of "one drug per GPCR target" and increasing interest in the identification of several drug options. Therefore, determining the appropriate context-dependent conformation of a functional GPCR as well as the contribution of GPCR alterations to cancer development remain significant challenges for the discovery of dominant cancer genes and the development of targeted therapeutics.},[m

How the chaperone network effectively protects integral membrane proteins during their post-translational targeting is not well understood. Here, biochemical reconstitutions showed that the yeast cytosolic Hsp70 is responsible for capturing newly synthesized tail-anchored membrane proteins (TAs) in the soluble form. Moreover, direct interaction of Hsp70 with the cochaperone Sgt2 initiates a sequential series of TA relays to the dedicated TA targeting factor Get3. In contrast to direct loading of TAs to downstream chaperones, stepwise substrate loading via Hsp70 maintains the solubility and targeting competence of TAs, ensuring their efficient delivery to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Inactivation of cytosolic Hsp70 severely impairs TA translocation in vivo Our results demonstrate a new role of cytosolic Hsp70 in directly assisting the targeting of an essential class of integral membrane proteins and provide a paradigm for how "substrate funneling" through a chaperone cascade preserves the conformational quality of nascent membrane proteins during their biogenesis.},[m

To understand the molecular principles that provide the vectorial driving force of these interactions, we developed quantitative fluorescence assays to monitor Get3-effector interactions at each stage of targeting. We show that nucleotide and substrate generate differential gradients of interaction energies that drive the ordered interaction of Get3 with successive effectors. These data also provide more molecular details on how the targeting complex is captured and disassembled by the ER receptor and reveal a previously unidentified role for Get4/5 in recycling Get3 from the ER membrane at the end of the targeting reaction.

However, how this leads to substrate insertion is unknown. Here we reconstitute peroxisome TA protein biogenesis into two sequential steps of substrate TMD engagement and membrane insertion. We identify a series of previously uncharacterized amphipathic segments in PEX19 and identify one whose hydrophobicity is required for membrane insertion, but not TMD chaperone activity or PEX3 binding. A membrane-proximal hydrophobic surface of PEX3 promotes an unconventional form of membrane intercalation, and is also required for TMD insertion. Together, these data support a mechanism in which hydrophobic moieties in the TMD chaperone and its membrane-associated receptor act in a concerted manner to prompt TMD release and membrane insertion.},[m

Despite the importance of correctly targeting a TA protein to its appropriate membrane, the mechanisms and signals involved are not fully understood. In this study, we identify additional peroxisomal TA proteins, discover more proteins that are present on multiple organelles, and reveal that a combination of TMD hydrophobicity and tail charge determines targeting to distinct organelle locations in mammals. Specifically, an increase in tail charge can override a hydrophobic TMD signal and re-direct a protein from the ER to peroxisomes or mitochondria and vice versa. We show that subtle changes in those parameters can shift TA proteins between organelles, explaining why peroxisomes and mitochondria have many of the same TA proteins. This enabled us to associate characteristic physicochemical parameters in TA proteins with particular organelle groups. Using this classification allowed successful prediction of the location of uncharacterized TA proteins for the first time.},[m

Both structures exhibit a Zn(2+)-mediated homodimer in a head-to-head orientation, representing an open dimer conformation.

Further, our coexpression-based binding assays using a model TA protein Sec22p revealed the direct interaction between the helical domain of Get3 and the Sec22p TMD. This interaction is independent of ATP and dimer formation. Finally, we propose a structural mechanism that links ATP hydrolysis with the TA-protein insertion mediated by the conserved DTAPTGH motif.},[m

 abstract = {The Get3 ATPase directs the delivery of tail-anchored (TA) proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). TA-proteins are characterized by having a single transmembrane helix (TM) at their extreme C terminus and include many essential proteins, such as SNAREs, apoptosis factors, and protein translocation components. These proteins cannot follow the SRP-dependent co-translational pathway that typifies most integral membrane proteins; instead, post-translationally, these proteins are recognized and bound by Get3 then delivered to the ER in the ATP dependent Get pathway. To elucidate a molecular mechanism for TA protein binding by Get3 we have determined three crystal structures in apo and ADP forms from Saccharomyces cerevisae (ScGet3-apo) and Aspergillus fumigatus (AfGet3-apo and AfGet3-ADP). Using structural information, we generated mutants to confirm important interfaces and essential residues. These results point to a model of how Get3 couples ATP hydrolysis to the binding and release of TA-proteins.},[m

Most membrane proteins are recognized and targeted co-translationally by the signal recognition particle. However, nearly 5{\%} of membrane proteins are 'tail-anchored' by a single carboxy-terminal transmembrane domain that cannot access the co-translational pathway. Instead, tail-anchored proteins are targeted post-translationally by a conserved ATPase termed Get3. The mechanistic basis for tail-anchored protein recognition or targeting by Get3 is not known. Here we present crystal structures of yeast Get3 in 'open' (nucleotide-free) and 'closed' (ADP.AlF(4)(-)-bound) dimer states. In the closed state, the dimer interface of Get3 contains an enormous hydrophobic groove implicated by mutational analyses in tail-anchored protein binding. In the open state, Get3 undergoes a striking rearrangement that disrupts the groove and shields its hydrophobic surfaces. These data provide a molecular mechanism for nucleotide-regulated binding and release of tail-anchored proteins during their membrane targeting by Get3.},[m

Here we show that Get3, the yeast homolog of the TA-interacting factor Asna1/Trc40, specifically recognizes TMDs of TA proteins destined for the secretory pathway. Get3 recognition represents a key decision step, whose loss can lead to misinsertion of TA proteins into mitochondria. Get3-TA protein complexes are recruited for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane insertion by the Get1/Get2 receptor. In vivo, the absence of Get1/Get2 leads to cytosolic aggregation of Get3-TA complexes and broad defects in TA protein biogenesis. In vitro reconstitution demonstrates that the Get proteins directly mediate insertion of newly synthesized TA proteins into ER membranes. Thus, the GET complex represents a critical mechanism for ensuring efficient and accurate targeting of TA proteins. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},[m

 abstract = {Tail-anchored (TA) protein synthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) represents a distinct and novel process that provides a paradigm for understanding post-translational membrane insertion in eukaryotes. The major route for delivering TA proteins to the ER requires both ATP and one or more cytosolic factors that facilitate efficient membrane insertion. Until recently, the identity of these cytosolic components was elusive, but two candidates have now been suggested to promote ATP-dependent TA protein integration. The first is the cytosolic chaperone complex of Hsp40/Hsc70, and the second is a novel ATPase denoted Asna-1 or TRC40. In this study we focus on the role of the Hsp40/Hsc70 complex in promoting TA protein biogenesis at the ER. We show that the membrane integration of most TA proteins is stimulated by Hsp40/Hsc70 when using purified components and a reconstituted system. In contrast, when both Hsp40/Hsc70 and Asna-1/TRC40 are provided as a complete system, small molecule inhibition of Hsp40/Hsc70 indicates that only a subset of TA proteins are obligatory clients for this chaperone-mediated delivery route. We show that the hydrophobicity of the TA region dictates whether a precursor is delivered to the ER via the Hsp40/Hsc70 or Asna-1/TRC40-dependent route, and we conclude that these distinct cytosolic ATPases are responsible for two different ATP-dependent pathways of TA protein biogenesis.},[m

Hsp70s stimulate protein folding by binding exposed hydrophobic sequences thereby preventing irreversible aggregation. Hsp40s stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp70s and target unfolded proteins to Hsp70s. Genetic and biochemical evidence supports a role for cytosolic Hsp70s and Hsp40s in the post-translational translocation of precursor proteins into endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. To gain mechanistic insight, we measured the effects of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ssa1p (Hsp70) and Ydj1p (Hsp40) on the translocation of histidine-tagged prepro-alpha-factor (ppalphaF6H) into microsomes. Radiolabeled ppalphaF6H was affinity purified from wheat germ translation reactions (or Escherichia coli) to remove endogenous chaperones. We demonstrated that either Ssa1p or Ydj1p stimulates post-translational translocation by preventing ppalphaF6H aggregation. The binding and/or hydrolysis of ATP by Ssa1p were required to maintain the translocation competence of ppalphaF6H. To clarify the contributions of membrane-bound and cytosolic Ydj1p, we compared the efficiency of chaperone-dependent translocation into wild-type and Ydj1p-deficient microsomes. Neither soluble nor membrane-bound Ydj1p was essential for post-translational protein translocation. The ability of Ssa1p, Ydj1p, or both chaperones to restore the translocation competence of aggregated ppalphaF6H was negligible.},[m

Here we have used the yeast system to study translocation of the C terminus of a tagged form of mammalian cytochrome b(5), carrying an N-glycosylation site in its C-terminal domain (b(5)-Nglyc). Utilization of this site was adopted as a rigorous criterion for translocation across the ER membrane of yeast wild-type and mutant cells. The C terminus of b(5)-Nglyc was rapidly glycosylated in mutants where Sec61p was defective and incapable of translocating carboxypeptidase Y, a well known substrate for post-translational translocation. Likewise, inactivation of several other components of the translocon machinery had no effect on b(5)-Nglyc translocation. The kinetics of translocation were faster for b(5)-Nglyc than for a signal peptide-containing reporter. Depletion of the cellular ATP pool to a level that retarded Sec61p-dependent post-translational translocation still allowed translocation of b(5)-Nglyc. Similarly, only low ATP concentrations (below 1 microm), in addition to cytosolic protein(s), were required for in vitro translocation of b(5)-Nglyc into mammalian microsomes. Thus, translocation of tail-anchored b(5)-Nglyc proceeds by a mechanism different from that of signal peptide-driven post-translational translocation.},[m

For example, mammalian TRC40 has a well-defined role during delivery of tail-anchored proteins to the ER. Although its Saccharomyces cerevisiae equivalent, Get3, is known to function in concert with at least four other components, Get1, Get2, Get4 and Get5 (Mdy2), the role of additional mammalian proteins during tail-anchored protein biogenesis is unclear. To this end, we analysed the cytosolic binding partners of Sec61beta, a well-defined substrate of TRC40, and identified Bat3 as a previously unknown interacting partner. Depletion of Bat3 inhibits the membrane integration of Sec61beta, but not of a second, TRC40-independent, tail-anchored protein, cytochrome b5. Thus, Bat3 influences the in vitro membrane integration of tail-anchored proteins using the TRC40 pathway. When expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking a functional GET pathway for tail-anchored protein biogenesis, Bat3 associates with the resulting cytosolic pool of non-targeted chains and diverts it to the nucleus. This Bat3-mediated mislocalisation is not dependent upon Sgt2, a recently identified component of the yeast GET pathway, and we propose that Bat3 either modulates the TRC40 pathway in higher eukaryotes or provides an alternative fate for newly synthesised tail-anchored proteins.},[m

We now report a novel post-translational function for SRP in the targeting of tail-anchored (TA) proteins to the ER. TA proteins possess a hydrophobic membrane insertion sequence at their C-terminus such that it can only emerge from the ribosome after translation is terminated. We show that SRP can associate post-translationally with this type of ER-targeting signal, and deliver newly synthesised TA proteins to the ER membrane by a pathway dependent upon GTP and the SRP receptor. We find that dependency upon this SRP-dependent route is precursor specific, and propose a unifying model to describe the biogenesis of TA proteins in vivo.},[m

SRbeta can be cross-linked to a 21 kDa ribosomal protein in its empty and GDP-bound state, but not when GTP is bound. GTP binding to SRbeta is required to induce signal sequence release from SRP. This is achieved by the presence of the translocon, which changes the interaction between the 21 kDa ribosomal protein and SRbeta and thereby allows SRbeta to bind GTP.

 abstract = {The t(14; 18) chromosomal translocation of human follicular B-cell lymphoma juxtaposes the bcl-2 gene with the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus. The bcl-2 immunoglobulin fusion gene is markedly deregulated resulting in inappropriately elevated levels of bcl-2 RNA and protein. Transgenic mice bearing a bcl-2 immunoglobulin minigene demonstrate a polyclonal expansion of resting yet responsive IgM-IgD B cells which display prolonged cell survival but no increase in cell cycling. Moreover, deregulated bcl-2 extends the survival of certain haematopoietic cell lines following growth-factor deprivation. By using immunolocalization studies we now demonstrate that Bcl-2 is an integral inner mitochondrial membrane protein of relative molecular mass 25,000 (25k). Overexpression of Bcl-2 blocks the apoptotic death of a pro-B-lymphocyte cell line. Thus, Bcl-2 is unique among proto-oncogenes, being localized to mitochondria and interfering with programmed cell death independent of promoting cell division.},[m

Based on co-immunoprecipitation and crystallographic studies, Get4 and Get5 formed a tight complex, suggesting that they constitute subunits of a larger complex. In contrast, although Get3 interacted physically with the Get4-Get5 complex, low amounts of Get3 co-precipitated with Get5, implying a transient interaction between Get3 and Get4-Get5.

Furthermore, in one heritable prion disease of humans, brain tissue contained CtmPrP but not PrPSc.

 abstract = {Geometrical validation around the C is described, with a new C measure and updated Ramachandran plot. Deviation of the observed C atom from ideal position provides a single measure encapsulating the major structure-validation information contained in bond angle distortions. C deviation is sensitive to incompatibilities between sidechain and backbone caused by misfit conformations or inappropriate refinement restraints. A new , plot using density-dependent smoothing for 81,234 non-Gly, non-Pro, and nonprePro residues with B {\textless} 30 from 500 high-resolution proteins shows sharp boundaries at critical edges and clear delineation between large empty areas and regions that are allowed but disfavored. One such region is the -turn conformation near 75°,60°, counted as forbidden by common structure- validation programs; however, it occurs in wellordered parts of good structures, it is overrepresented near functional sites, and strain is partly compensated by the -turn H-bond. Favored and allowed , regions are also defined for Pro, pre- Pro, and Gly (important because Gly , angles are more permissive but less accurately determined). Details of these accurate empirical distributions are poorly predicted by previous theoretical calculations, including a region left of -helix, which rates as favorable in energy yet rarely occurs. A proposed factor explaining this discrepancy is that crowding of the two-peptide NHs permits donating only a single H-bond. New calculations by Hu et al. [Proteins 2002 (this issue)] for Ala and Gly dipeptides, using mixed quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics, fit our nonrepetitive data in excellent detail.

Translation arrest peptide (AP) experiments are used to measure the external pulling forces that are exerted on the NC at different lengths during translation. To elucidate the molecular origins of these forces, a recently developed coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) is used to directly simulate the observed pulling-force profiles, thereby disentangling contributions from NC-translocon and NC-ribosome interactions, membrane partitioning, and electrostatic coupling to the membrane potential. This combination of experiment and theory reveals mechanistic features of Sec-facilitated membrane integration and protein translocation, including the interplay between transient interactions and conformational changes that occur during ribosomal translation to govern protein biogenesis.},[m

 abstract = {Although transmembrane proteins generally require membrane-embedded machinery for integration, a few can insert spontaneously into liposomes. Previously, we established that the tail-anchored (TA) protein cytochrome b(5) (b5) can posttranslationally translocate 28 residues downstream to its transmembrane domain (TMD) across protein-free bilayers (Brambillasca, S., M. Yabal, P. Soffientini, S. Stefanovic, M. Makarow, R.S. Hegde, and N. Borgese. 2005. EMBO J. 24:2533-2542). In the present study, we investigated the limits of this unassisted translocation and report that surprisingly long (85 residues) domains of different sequence and charge placed downstream of b5's TMD can posttranslationally translocate into mammalian microsomes and liposomes at nanomolar nucleotide concentrations. Furthermore, integration of these constructs occurred in vivo in translocon-defective yeast strains. Unassisted translocation was not unique to b5 but was also observed for another TA protein (protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B) whose TMD, like the one of b5, is only moderately hydrophobic. In contrast, more hydrophobic TMDs, like synaptobrevin's, were incapable of supporting unassisted integration, possibly because of their tendency to aggregate in aqueous solution. Our data resolve long-standing discrepancies on TA protein insertion and are relevant to membrane evolution, biogenesis, and physiology.},[m

The posttranslational targeting of tail-anchored proteins (TAs) provides tractable model systems to probe these fundamental issues. Recent advances in under-standing TA-targeting pathways reveal sophisticated molecular machineries that drive and regulate these processes.

 abstract = {While interactions of single-span transmembrane helices have been studied to a significant extent in the past years, the folding of polytopic $\alpha$-helical transmembrane proteins, as well as their oligomerization, are far less analyzed and understood. The goal of the few thus far performed thermodynamic studies, in which unfolding of polytopic TM proteins was described, was to achieve a mild, potentially reversible unfolding process, to finally derive thermodynamic parameters for the reverse folding pathway. In the first part of this review, we summarize the studies analyzing the thermodynamic stability and folding pathways of polytopic transmembrane proteins. Based on these studies, we deduce some common principles, guiding transmembrane protein unfolding and folding, important for the design of future folding/unfolding studies. Furthermore, the discussed observations can conceptually guide an experimental search for proper in vitro transmembrane protein refolding conditions. In many of the resolved membrane protein structures, individual monomers interact to form higher ordered oligomers. In most cases, oligomerization of those monomeric units appears to be intimately linked to the protein function, and folding of the individual protomers might even occur only after interaction. In the second part of this review, we discuss folding pathways of oligomeric $\alpha$-helical transmembrane proteins as well as causes and consequences of $\alpha$-helical transmembrane protein oligomerization.},[m

 abstract = {Electrostatic potentials along the ribosomal exit tunnel are nonuniform and negative. The significance of electrostatics in the tunnel remains relatively uninvestigated, yet they are likely to play a role in translation and secondary folding of nascent peptides. To probe the role of nascent peptide charges in ribosome function, we used a molecular tape measure that was engineered to contain different numbers of charged amino acids localized to known regions of the tunnel and measured chain elongation rates. Positively charged arginine or lysine sequences produce transient arrest (pausing) before the nascent peptide is fully elongated. The rate of conversion from transiently arrested to full-length nascent peptide is faster for peptides containing neutral or negatively charged residues than for those containing positively charged residues. We provide experimental evidence that extraribosomal mechanisms do not account for this charge-specific pausing. We conclude that pausing is due to charge-specific interactions between the tunnel and the nascent peptide. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},[m

 abstract = {Tail-anchored (TA) proteins are membrane proteins that contain an N-terminal domain exposed to the cytosol and a single transmembrane segment near the C-terminus followed by few or no polar residues. TA proteins with a mildly hydrophobic transmembrane domain, such as cytochrome b5 (b5), are able to insert post-translationally into pure lipid vesicles without assistance from membrane proteins. Here, we investigated whether any cytosolic proteins are needed to maintain b5 in a competent state for transmembrane integration. Using b5 constructs translated in vitro or produced in bacteria, we demonstrate that cytosolic proteins are neither necessary nor facilitatory for the unassisted translocation of b5. Furthermore, we demonstrate that no cytosolic protein is involved in the translocation of a C-terminal domain of 85 residues appended to the transmembrane domain of b5. Nevertheless, b5 does bind cytosolic proteins, and in their presence but not in their absence, its insertion into liposomes is inhibited by the thiol oxidant diamide and the alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide. The effect of diamide is also observed in living cells. Thus, the specific in vivo targeting of b5 might be achieved by interaction with redox-sensitive targeting factors that hinder its nonspecific insertion into any permissive bilayer.},[m

 abstract = {Liposomes can be used as drug delivery vehicles and like other nanoparticles, it offers a beneficial distribution mechanism for in vivo therapeutics. Although therapeutic liposomes reach tissues through entirely passive means it is possible to increase liposome uptake by a specific target cell type. Cell specificity in liposomal drug delivery can be achieved by displaying receptor specific targeting peptides on the liposome surface. These ligands evoke endocytic uptake of the liposome upon binding their cognate cell surface receptor and the liposome cargo is subsequently delivered to an intracellular compartment. The methodology used to attach such targeting peptides to liposomes is currently limited by the chemistry of conjugation reactions with functional groups that are attached to the lipid constituents. This project set out to explore an alternative method of ligand attachment using novel chimeric tail-anchored (TA) proteins. Several studies suggest that the transmembrane domain of the TA protein cytochrome b5 is capable of spontaneous insertion into synthetic membranes. Hence, artificial protein chimeras containing the transmembrane domain from cytochrome b5 were created and I showed that these polypeptides provided a robust membrane tether for the incorporation of three different targeting moieties into preformed liposomes. These TA protein chimeras were used to investigate their effect on liposome uptake using two cell culture models. When liposomes loaded with a model fluorescent cargo were modified with the chimeric polypeptides, one of the targeting ligands chosen for study significantly enhanced the association of the liposomes with both cell types. Furthermore, in the case of HeLa M cells I was also able to show that the liposome cargo was successfully internalised. However, when the liposomes were loaded with the cytotoxic drug doxorubicin, the effects of the ligands, as judged on the basis of cell viability and caspase activation, were comparatively modest. I speculate about the likely basis for these findings and discuss whether the attachment of targeting ligands to liposomes through tail- anchoring could play a role in the design of future drug delivery systems.},[m

 abstract = {Many endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins maintain their residence by dynamic retrieval from downstream compartments of the secretory pathway. In previous work we compared the retrieval process mediated by the two signals, KKMP and KDEL, by appending them to the same neutral reporter protein, CD8, and found that the two signals determine a different steady-state localiza- tion of the reporter. CD8-K (the KDEL-bearing form) was restricted mainly to the ER, whereas CD8-E19 (the KKMP-bearing form) was distributed also to the intermediate compartment and Golgi complex. To investigate whether this different steady-state distribution reflects a difference in exit rates from the ER and/or in retrieval, we have now followed the first steps of export of the two constructs from the ER and their trafficking between ER and Golgi complex. Contrary to expectation, we find that CD8-K is efficiently recruited into transport vesicles, whereas CD8-E19 is not. Thus, the more restricted ER localization of CD8-K must be explained by a more efficient retrieval to the ER. Moreover, because most of ER resident CD8-K is notO-glycosylated but almost all CD8-E19 is, the results suggest that CD8-K is retrieved from the intermediate compartment, before reaching the Golgi, where O-glycosylation begins. These results illustrate how different retrieval signals determine different trafficking patterns and pose novel questions on the under- lying molecular mechanisms.},[m

 abstract = {The complete genome sequence of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans provides an excellent basis for studying the distribution and evolution of protein families in higher eukaryotes. Three fundamental questions are as follows: How many paralog clusters exist in one species, how many of these are shared with other species, and how many proteins can be assigned a functional counterpart in other species? We have addressed these questions in a detailed study of predicted membrane proteins in C. elegans and their mammalian homologs. All worm proteins predicted to contain at least two transmembrane segments were clustered on the basis of sequence similarity. This resulted in 189 groups with two or more sequences, containing, in total, 2647 worm proteins. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) were created for each family, and were used to retrieve mammalian homologs from the SWISSPROT, TREMBL, and VTS databases. About one-half of these clusters had mammalian homologs. Putative worm-mammalian orthologs were extracted by use of nine different phylogenetic methods and BLAST. Eight clusters initially thought to be worm-specific were assigned mammalian homologs after searching EST and genomic sequences. A compilation of 174 orthology assignments made with high confidence is presented. [Tables describing transmembrane protein families and orthology assignments are available from ftp.cgr.ki.se/pub/data/worm.] The first multicellular organism with a completely se-quenced genome is the roundworm Caenorhabditis el-egans (Consortium 1998). The genome comprises ∼100 million basepairs, and is predicted to encode ∼19,000 proteins. Previous analysis has revealed that approxi-mately two-thirds of the proteins can be assigned a tentative biochemical function on the basis of se-quence homology to proteins of known function. A majority of the proteins have homologs within the worm genome (paralogs). The fraction of proteins with a detectable paralog has been estimated by two differ-ent methods to within 66{\%} and 95{\%} (Sonnhammer and Durbin 1997; Teichmann and Chothia 2000). It was also noted that a large fraction of the paralog clus-ters do not match proteins in other species. Sonnham-mer and Durbin (1997) presented a dozen of the largest such cases and showed that some clusters could be as-signed a tentative function by use of hidden Markov models (HMMs). Multiple alignment-based homology search methods such as HMMs and profiles are consid-ered more sensitive than single-sequence methods (Eddy 1996, 1998; Park et al. 1998). Examples of HMM-based protein family databases are Pfam (Bateman et al. 2000) and SMART (Schultz et al. 2000). Our aim was to classify all membrane proteins in C. elegans by grouping them in clusters of paralogs, and annotating them according to sequence homology to proteins with a known function and orthology to mammalian proteins. The membrane proteins are at-tractive for several reasons. They form a rather well-defined group of an easily predicted class of proteins. Membrane proteins contain many interesting recep-tors and signaling proteins that are particularly impor-tant in multicellular organisms and cannot be studied in bacteria or in yeast. Membrane proteins are also challenging for many sequence comparison programs because of high degeneracy in hydrophobic membrane domains. Because of their special environment, mem-brane proteins, overall, are thought to be less con-strained in sequence than water-soluble domains, and therefore evolve more rapidly. Our main interest was concentrated on the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family (Kolakowski 1994; Horn et al. 1998). GPCRs are represented in the Pfam database by five different families. These models and/or simple pairwise comparisons are often used to discover novel GPCR genes (Bargmann 1998; Robert-son 1998, 2000). However, the use of only models of well-established families reduces the chance of finding any new genes that could have the same function, but lack obvious sequence similarity. Alternative methods, not dependent on sequence similarity to known GPCRs could be useful to discover distinct novel fami-lies. For example, several new GPCR sequences have been found from Drosophila genome by modeling the pattern of their transmembrane domains (Clyne et al. 1999). We use a similar approach to find and charac-terize membrane proteins from C. elegans. Briefly, we},[m

We present here a new tool for discovery of such unstructured, or disordered regions within proteins. GlobPlot (http://globplot.embl.de) is a web service that allows the user to plot the tendency within the query protein for order/globularity and disorder. We show examples with known proteins where it successfully identifies inter-domain segments containing linear motifs, and also apparently ordered regions that do not contain any recognised domain. GlobPlot may be useful in domain hunting efforts. The plots indicate that instances of known domains may often contain additional N- or C-terminal segments that appear ordered. Thus GlobPlot may be of use in the design of constructs corresponding to globular proteins, as needed for many biochemical studies, particularly structural biology. GlobPlot has a pipeline interface--GlobPipe--for the advanced user to do whole proteome analysis.

 abstract = {Membrane protein folding and topogenesis are tuned to a given lipid profile since lipids and proteins have co-evolved to follow a set of interdependent rules governing final protein topological organization. Transmembrane domain (TMD) topology is determined via a dynamic process in which topogenic signals in the nascent protein are recognized and interpreted initially by the translocon followed by a given lipid profile in accordance with the Positive Inside Rule. The net zero charged phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine and other neutral lipids dampen the translocation potential of negatively charged residues in favor of the cytoplasmic retention potential of positively charged residues (Charge Balance Rule). This explains why positively charged residues are more potent topological signals than negatively charged residues. Dynamic changes in orientation of TMDs during or after membrane insertion are attributed to non-sequential cooperative and collective lipid-protein charge interactions as well as long-term interactions within a protein. The proportion of dual topological conformers of a membrane protein varies in a dose responsive manner with changes in the membrane lipid composition not only in vivo but also in vitro and therefore is determined by the membrane lipid composition. Switching between two opposite TMD topologies can occur in either direction in vivo and also in liposomes (designated as fliposomes) independent of any other cellular factors. Such lipid-dependent post-insertional reversibility of TMD orientation indicates a thermodynamically driven process that can occur at any time and in any cell membrane driven by changes in the lipid composition. This dynamic view of protein topological organization influenced by the lipid environment reveals previously unrecognized possibilities for cellular regulation and understanding of disease states resulting from mis-folded proteins.

Voltage activation has been suggested to involve paddles, each composed of a mildly hydrophobic S3 helix packed against a highly charged S4 helix, that move through the lipid bilayer in response to membrane depolarization (2). This controversial mechanism of gating is at odds with models that envisage the S4 segment as isolated from the lipid bilayer in canaliculi within the channel protein.

Here we highlight recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this pathway, and discuss new questions raised by these findings.},[m

 abstract = {The signal recognition particle (SRP) mediates the co-translational targeting of nascent proteins to the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum membrane, or the bacterial plasma membrane. During this process, two GTPases, one in the SRP and one in the SRP receptor (SR), form a complex in which both proteins reciprocally activate the GTPase reaction of one another. The recent crystal structures of the T. aquaticus SRP{\textperiodcentered}SR complex show that the two GTPases associate via an unusually extensive and highly cooperative interaction surface, and form a composite active site at the interface. GTPase activation proceeds through a unique mechanism, stimulated by both interactions between the twinned GTP molecules across the dimer interface and by conformational rearrangements that position catalytic residues in each active site with respect to the bound substrates. Distinct classes of mutations have been isolated that inhibit specific stages during SRP-SR complex formation and activation, suggesting discrete conformational stages during formation of the active SRP{\textperiodcentered}SR complex. Each stage provides a potential control point in the targeting reaction at which regulation by additional components can be exerted, thus ensuring the binding and release of cargo at the appropriate time. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of the Federation of European Biochemical Societies.},[m

Achieving accuracy is challenging, as the molecular signals that dictate a protein's cellular destination are often promiscuous. A salient example is the targeting of an essential class of tail-anchored (TA) proteins, whose sole defining feature is a transmembrane domain near their C-terminus. Here we show that the Guided Entry of Tail-anchored protein (GET) pathway selects TA proteins destined to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) utilizing distinct molecular steps, including differential binding by the co-chaperone Sgt2 and kinetic proofreading after ATP hydrolysis by the targeting factor Get3. Further, the different steps select for distinct physicochemical features of the TA substrate. The use of multiple selection filters may be general to protein biogenesis pathways that must distinguish correct and incorrect substrates based on minor differences.},[m

Although the interaction between the bacterial SecYEG translocon and YidC has been observed in multiple studies, it is still unknown which domains of YidC are in contact with the SecYEG translocon. By in vivo and in vitro site-directed and para-formaldehyde cross-linking we identified the auxiliary transmembrane domain 1 of E. coli YidC as a major contact site for SecY and SecG. Additional SecY contacts were observed for the tightly packed globular domain and the C1 loop of YidC, which reveals that the hydrophilic cavity of YidC faces the lateral gate of SecY. Surprisingly, YidC-SecYEG contacts were only observed when YidC and SecYEG were present at about stoichiometric concentrations, suggesting that the YidC-SecYEG contact in vivo is either very transient or only observed for a very small SecYEG sub-population. This is different for the YidC-SRP and YidC-FtsY interaction, which involves the C1 loop of YidC and is efficiently observed even at sub-stoichiometric concentrations of SRP/FtsY. In summary, our data provide a first detailed view on how YidC interacts with the SecYEG translocon and the SRP-targeting machinery.},[m

We find that interactions between residues in a C-terminally located transmembrane helix and in more N-terminally located helices can be detected already at the point when the C-terminal helix partitions from the translocon into the membrane.

The quality control mechanisms that oversee these processes remain poorly understood. We show that less hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) regions derived from several single-pass TM proteins can enter the ER lumen completely. Once mislocalized, they are recognized by the Hsp70 chaperone BiP. In a detailed analysis for one of these proteins, the $\alpha$$\beta$T cell receptor ($\alpha$$\beta$TCR), we show that unassembled ER-lumenal subunits are rapidly degraded, whereas specific subunit interactions en route to the native receptor promote membrane integration of the less hydrophobic TM segments, thereby stabilizing the protein. For the TCR $\alpha$ chain, both complete ER import and subunit assembly depend on the same pivotal residue in its TM region. Thus, membrane integration linked to protein assembly allows cellular quality control of membrane proteins and connects the lumenal ER chaperone machinery to membrane protein biogenesis. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},[m

Cytoplasmic segments of SecY orient the C-terminal $\alpha$-helical region of another molecule, suggesting a general binding mode and a promiscuous guiding surface capable of accommodating diverse nascent chains at the exit of the ribosomal tunnel. To accommodate this putative nascent chain mimic, the cytoplasmic vestibule widens, and a lateral exit portal is opened throughout its entire length for partition of transmembrane helical segments to the lipid bilayer. In this primed channel, the central plug still occludes the pore while the lateral gate is opened, enabling topological arbitration during early protein insertion. In vivo, a 15 amino acid truncation of the cytoplasmic C-terminal helix of SecY fails to rescue a secY-deficient strain, supporting the essential role of this helix as suggested from the structure.},[m

 abstract = {For the first time, the standard free energy change, delta Gzero, of a membrane-inserting protein with a leader sequence has been determined experimentally, using M13 procoat protein as an example. The partition coefficient for the distribution of the procoat protein between the aqueous phase and the membrane phase of preformed lipid vesicles yielded a value of gamma = 6.5 x 10(5) M-1, corresponding to a delta Gzero of -10.4 kcal/mol, based on measurements of the fluorescence energy transfer between the intrinsic tryptophan of the protein and a suitably labeled lipid membrane of POPC. For comparison, the partition coefficient of the M13 coat protein between the aqueous and the POPC lipid bilayer phase was determined to be distinctly lower: gamma = 1 x 10(5) M-1 (delta Gzero = -9.3 kcal/mol). Proteinase K digestion experiments have been performed, showing that 20{\%} of the procoat protein bound to lipid vesicles spontaneously integrate in a transbilayer form, whereas 80{\%} remain inserted in the interfacial membrane region. By taking together these results, an upper limit for the free energy change of the transmembrane insertion of procoat protein was estimated to be -14.8 kcal/mol. In order to distinguish further the contribution arising from insertion of the procoat protein into the membrane interfacial region from that due to transmembrane insertion, the partition coefficient of the mutant procoat protein OM30R [which contains a positively charged amino acid in its mature hydrophobic segment (exchange of a Val to an Arg residue at position 30)] was determined, yielding gamma = 0.3 x 10(5) M-1 (delta Gzero = -8.6 kcal/mol). Previously reported in vivo experiments have shown that the OM30R mutant protein is not translocated across Escherichia coli membranes but only binds to the inner surface. The results presented here indicate that although the insertion of the procoat protein into the interfacial region of the lipid bilayer contributes the major part to delta Gzero, it is the final energy gain of the interaction of the hydrophobic portions of the folded pre-protein with the lipid chains which drives the transmembrane insertion of the M13 procoat protein. Neither the leader sequence nor the mature coat protein alone yields this free energy gain. For the different proteins investigated here, spontaneous membrane insertion occurs only for fluid lipid bilayers, but not for membranes in the crystalline lipid phase. Furthermore, by using lipid bilayers with negative membrane surface charges, it was shown that both procoat and coat proteins are electrostatically attracted to the surface of the lipid membrane, though only to a small extent, with apparent partition coefficients of the same order of magnitude as for the phosphatidylcholine lipid membrane.},[m

 abstract = {Membrane proteins constitute about one third of the proteome. The ubiquitous Sec machinery facilitates protein movement across or integration of proteins into the cytoplasmic membrane. In Escherichia coli post- and co-translational targeting pathways converge at the protein-conducting channel, consisting of a central pore, SecYEG, which can recruit accessory domains SecDF-YajC and YidC, to form the holotranslocon (HTL) supercomplex. Detailed analysis of HTL function and architecture remained elusive until recently, largely due to the lack of a purified, recombinant complex. ACEMBL is an advanced DNA recombineering-based expression vector system we developed for producing challenging multiprotein complexes. ACEMBL affords the means to combine multiple expression elements including promoter DNAs, tags, genes of interest, and terminators in a combinatorial manner until optimal multigene expression plasmids are constructed that yield correctly assembled, homogenous, and active multiprotein complex specimens. We utilized ACEMBL for recombinant HTL overproduction. We developed protocols for detergent solubilizing and purifying the HTL. Highly purified complex was then used to reveal HTL function and the interactions between its constituents. HTL activity in protein secretion and membrane protein insertion was analyzed in both the presence and absence of the proton-motive force. Setting up ACEMBL for the assembly of multigene expression constructs that achieve high yields of functional multisubunit membrane protein complex is straightforward. Here, we used ACEMBL for obtaining active HTL supercomplex in high quality and quantity. The concept can likewise be applied to obtain many other assemblies of similar complexity, by overexpression in prokaryotic, and also eukaryotic hosts.},[m

Here, we have used translational arrest peptides as in vivo force sensors to measure this electric force during cotranslational chain translocation through the SecYEG translocon. We find that charged residues experience a biphasic electric force as they move across the membrane, including an early component with a maximum when they are 47-49 residues away from the ribosomal P site, followed by a more slowly varying component. The early component is generated by the transmembrane electric potential, whereas the second may reflect interactions between charged residues and the periplasmic membrane surface.},[m

The PRS favorably influenced non-Black Ss' attitudes toward Blacks, while lectures and viewing the PRS on film did not appear to influence controls' attitudes. Statistical evidence supporting the effectiveness of the activity for prejudice reduction was moderate. Ss and the PRS facilitator reported stress from the PRS.

 abstract = {The de novo design of proteins is a rigorous test of our understanding of the key determinants of protein structure. The helix bundle is an interesting de novo design model system due to the diverse topologies that can be generated from a few simple $\alpha$-helices. Previously, non-computational studies demonstrated that connecting amphipathic helices together with short loops can sometimes generate helix bundle proteins, regardless of the bundle's exact sequence. However using such methods, the precise positions of helices and side-chains cannot be predetermined. Since protein function depends on exact positioning of residues, we examined if sequence design tools in the program Rosetta could be used to design a four-helix bundle with a predetermined structure. Helix position was specified using a folding procedure that constrained the design model to a defined topology, and iterative rounds of rotamer-based sequence design and backbone refinement were used to identify a low energy sequence for characterization. The designed protein, DND{\_}4HB, unfolds cooperatively (Tm {\textgreater}90°C) and a NMR solution structure shows that it adopts the target helical bundle topology. Helices 2, 3 and 4 agree very closely with the design model (backbone RMSD = 1.11 {\AA}) and {\textgreater}90{\%} of the core side-chain $\chi$1 and $\chi$2 angles are correctly predicted. Helix 1 lies in the target groove against the other helices, but is displaced 3 {\AA} along the bundle axis. This result highlights the potential of computational design to create bundles with atomic-level precision, but also points at remaining challenges for achieving specific positioning between amphipathic helices.},[m

 abstract = {A defining feature of eukaryotic polytopic protein biogenesis involves integration, folding, and packing of hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) segments into the apolar environment of the lipid bilayer. In the endoplasmic reticulum, this process is facilitated by the Sec61 translocon. Here, we use a photocross-linking approach to examine integration intermediates derived from the ATP-binding cassette transporter cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and show that the timing of translocon-mediated integration can be regulated at specific stages of synthesis. During CFTR biogenesis, the eighth TM segment exits the ribosome and enters the translocon in proximity to Sec61alpha. This interaction is initially weak, and TM8 spontaneously dissociates from the translocon when the nascent chain is released from the ribosome. Polypeptide extension by only a few residues, however, results in stable TM8-Sec61alpha photocross-links that persist after peptidyl-tRNA bond cleavage. Retention of these untethered polypeptides within the translocon requires ribosome binding and is mediated by an acidic residue, Asp924, near the center of the putative TM8 helix. Remarkably, at this stage of synthesis, nascent chain release from the translocon is also strongly inhibited by ATP depletion. These findings contrast with passive partitioning models and indicate that Sec61alpha can retain TMs and actively inhibit membrane integration in a sequence-specific and ATP-dependent manner.},[m

We reconstituted the core reactions for membrane targeting and ubiquitination of nascent tail-anchored membrane proteins to understand how their fate is determined. The central six-component triage system is divided into an uncommitted client-SGTA complex, a self-sufficient targeting module, and an embedded but self-sufficient quality control module. Client-SGTA engagement of the targeting module induces rapid, private, and committed client transfer to TRC40 for successful biosynthesis. Commitment to ubiquitination is dictated primarily by comparatively slower client dissociation from SGTA and nonprivate capture by the BAG6 subunit of the quality control module. Our results provide a paradigm for how priority and time are encoded within a multichaperone triage system.},[m

Programs sequence (SEG) and protein sequence (PSEG) are tuned for amino acid sequences and nucleotide sequence (NSEG) for nucleotide sequences. The programs can be applied to either individual sequences, including whole chromosomes if appropriate, or entire sequence databases. Compositional complexity is based only on residue composition, regardless of the patterns or periodicity of sequence repetitiveness. This contrasts with some alternative methods that use counts of k-grams to define residue patterns and clustering. Complexity, pattern, and periodicity are distinct abstract attributes of simple sequences. For genomic studies, it is essential to view compositional bias in the context of many types of other features, such as recognizable functional sites, transcripts, coding sequences, and homologies. For this purpose, the SEG family of programs is being integrated into software packages, or workbenches, that have graphic multilevel browsing facilities and include zoom functions.},[m

 abstract = {In one of the most extensive analyses to date we show that the balance of diet n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is the most important determinant of membrane composition in the rat under 'normal' conditions. Young adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed one of twelve moderate-fat diets (25{\%} of total energy) for 8 weeks. Diets differed only in fatty acid (FA) profiles, with saturate (SFA) content ranging 8-88{\%} of total FAs, monounsaturate (MUFA) 6-65{\%}, total PUFA 4-81{\%}, n-6 PUFA 3-70{\%} and n-3 PUFA 1-70{\%}. Diet PUFA included only essential FAs 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3. Balance between n-3 and n-6 PUFA is defined as the PUFA balance (n-3 PUFA as {\%} of total PUFA) and ranged 1-86{\%} in the diets. FA composition was measured for brain, heart, liver, skeletal muscle, erythrocytes and plasma phospholipids, as well as adipose tissue and plasma triglycerides. The conformer-regulator model was used (slope = 1 indicates membrane composition completely conforming to diet). Extensive changes in diet SFA, MUFA and PUFA had minimal effect on membranes (average slopes 0.01, 0.07, 0.07 respectively), but considerable influence on adipose tissue and plasma triglycerides (average slopes 0.27, 0.53, 0.47 respectively). Diet balance between n-3 and n-6 PUFA had a biphasic influence on membrane composition. When n-3 PUFA {\textless} 10{\%} of total PUFA, membrane composition completely conformed to diet (average slope 0.95), while diet PUFA balance {\textgreater} 10{\%} had little influence (average slope 0.19). The modern human diet has an average PUFA balance {\~{}} 10{\%} and this will likely have significant health implications. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},[m

 abstract = {Voltage-gated calcium channels are required for many key functions in the body. In this review, the different subtypes of voltage-gated calcium channels are described and their physiologic roles and pharmacology are outlined. We describe the current uses of drugs interacting with the different calcium channel subtypes and subunits, as well as specific areas in which there is strong potential for future drug development. Current therapeutic agents include drugs targeting L-type CaV1.2 calcium channels, particularly 1,4-dihydropyridines, which are widely used in the treatment of hypertension. T-type (CaV3) channels are a target of ethosuximide, widely used in absence epilepsy. The auxiliary subunit a2d-1 is the therapeutic target of the gabapentinoid drugs, which are of value in certain epilepsies and chronic neuropathic pain. The limited use of intrathecal ziconotide, a peptide blocker of N-type (CaV2.2) calcium channels, as a treatment of intractable pain, gives an indication that these channels represent excellent drug targets for various pain conditions. We describe how selectivity for different subtypes of calcium channels (e.g., CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 L-type channels) may be achieved in the future by exploiting differences between channel isoforms in terms of sequence and biophysical properties, variation in splicing in different target tissues, and differences in the properties of the target tissues themselves in terms of membrane potential or firing frequency. Thus, use-dependent blockers of the different isoforms could selectively block calcium channels in particular pathologies, such as nociceptive neurons in pain states or in epileptic brain circuits. Of important future potential are selective CaV1.3 blockers for neuropsychiatric diseases, neuroprotection in Parkinson's disease, and resistant hypertension. In addition, selective or nonselective T-type channel blockers are considered potential therapeutic targets in epilepsy, pain, obesity, sleep, and anxiety. Use-dependent N-type calcium channel blockers are likely to be of therapeutic use in chronic pain conditions. Thus, more selective calcium channel blockers hold promise for therapeutic intervention. {\textcopyright} 2015 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.},[m

 abstract = {Cl- channels reside both in the plasma membrane and in intracellular organelles. Their functions range from ion homeostasis to cell volume regulation, transepithelial transport, and regulation of electrical excitability. Their physiological roles are impressively illustrated by various inherited diseases and knock-out mouse models. Thus the loss of distinct Cl- channels leads to an impairment of transepithelial transport in cystic fibrosis and Bartter's syndrome, to increased muscle excitability in myotonia congenita, to reduced endosomal acidification and impaired endocytosis in Dent's disease, and to impaired extracellular acidification by osteoclasts and osteopetrosis. The disruption of several Cl- channels in mice results in blindness. Several classes of Cl- channels have not yet been identified at the molecular level. Three molecularly distinct Cl- channel families (CLC, CFTR, and ligand-gated GABA and glycine receptors) are well established. Mutagenesis and functional studies have yielded considerable insights into their structure and function. Recently, the detailed structure of bacterial CLC proteins was determined by X-ray analysis of three-dimensional crystals. Nonetheless, they are less well understood than cation channels and show remarkably different biophysical and structural properties. Other gene families (CLIC or CLCA) were also reported to encode Cl- channels but are less well characterized. This review focuses on molecularly identified Cl- channels and their physiological roles.},[m

 abstract = {Potassium channels are multi-subunit complexes, often composed of several polytopic membrane proteins and cytosolic proteins. The formation of these oligomeric structures, including both biogenesis and trafficking, is the subject of this review. The emphasis is on events in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), particularly on how, where, and when K(+) channel polypeptides translocate and integrate into the bilayer, oligomerize and fold to form pore-forming units, and associate with auxiliary subunits to create the mature channel complex. Questions are raised with respect to the sequence of these events, when biogenic decisions are made, models for integration of K(+) channel transmembrane segments, crosstalk between the cell surface and ER, and recognition of compatible partner subunits. Also considered are determinants of subunit composition and stoichiometry, their consequence for trafficking, mechanisms for ER retention and export, and sequence motifs that direct channels to the cell surface. It is these mechanistic issues that govern the differential distributions of K(+) conductances at the cell surface, and hence the electrical activity of cells and tissues underlying both the physiology and pathophysiology of an organism.},[m

 abstract = {The function of membrane proteins relies on a defined orientation of protein relative to lipid. In apparent correlation to protein anchoring, tryptophan residues are enriched in the lipid headgroup region. To characterize the thermodynamic and structural basis of this relationship in $\alpha$-helical membrane proteins, we examined the role of three conserved tryptophans in the folding of the heterodimeric integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 transmembrane (TM) complex in phospholipid bicelles and mammalian membranes. In the homogenous lipid environment of bicelles, tryptophan was replaceable by residues of distinct polarities. The appropriate polarity was guided by the electrostatic potential of the tryptophan surrounding, suggesting that tryptophan can complement diverse environments by adjusting the orientation of its anisotropic side chain to achieve site-specific anchoring. As a sole membrane anchor, tryptophan made a contribution of 0.4 kcal/mol to TM complex stability in bicelles. In membranes, it proved more difficult to replace tryptophan even by tyrosine, indicating a superior capacity to interact with heterogeneous lipids of biological membranes. Interestingly, at intracellular TM helix ends, where integrin activation is initiated, sequence motifs that interact with lipids via opposing polarity patterns were found to restrict TM helix orientations beyond tryptophan anchoring. In contrast to bicelles, phenylalanine became the least accepted substitute in membranes, demonstrating an increased role of the hydrophobic effect. Altogether, our study implicates a wide amphiphilic range of tryptophan, membrane complexity, and the hydrophobic effect to be important factors in tryptophan membrane anchoring.},[m

 abstract = {The druggable subset of the human genome, termed the "druggable genome," provides the pharmaceutical industry with a unique opportunity for the advancement of new therapeutic interventions for a multitude of diseases and disorders. To date, there is no systematic assessment of the evolutionary history and nature of the defined druggable proteins derived from the contemporary druggable genome (i.e., proteins that bind or are predicted to bind with high affinity to a biologic). An understanding of drug-protein target interactions in specific cellular compartments is crucial for the optimal therapeutic delivery of pharmaceutical agents, as well as for preclinical drug trials in model animals. This study applied the concept of pharmacophylogenomics, the study of genes, evolution, and drug targets, to conduct an evolutionary survey of drug targets with respect to their subcellular localizations. Using multiple models and modes of druggable genome comparison, the results concordantly indicated that orthologous drug targets with a nuclear localization in the human, macaque, mouse, and rat showed a higher trend for evolutionary conservation compared with drug targets in the cell membrane and the extracellular compartment. As such, this study provides important information regarding druggable protein targets and the druggable genome at the pharmacophylogenomics level.},[m

 abstract = {The Sec61 translocon catalyzes translocation of proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum and the lateral integration of transmembrane segments into the lipid bilayer. Integration is mediated by the hydrophobicity of a polypeptide segment consistent with thermodynamic equilibration between the translocon and the lipid membrane. Integration efficiency of a generic series of increasingly hydrophobic sequences (H-segments) was found to diverge significantly in different reporter constructs as a function of the ∼100 residues that are C-terminal to the H-segments. The hydrophobicity threshold of integration was considerably lowered through insertion of generic ∼20-residue peptides either made of flexible glycine-serine repeats, containing multiple negative charges, or consisting of an oligoproline stretch. A highly flexible, 100-residue glycine-serine stretch maximally enhanced this effect. The apparent free energy of integration was found to be changed by more than 3 kcal/mol with the downstream sequences tested. The C-terminal sequences could also be shown to affect integration of natural mildly hydrophobic sequences. The results suggest that the conformation of the nascent polypeptide in the protected cavity between the ribosome and translocon considerably influences the release of the H-segment into the bilayer.},[m

 abstract = {Binding of the retroviral structural protein Gag to the cellular plasma membrane is mediated by the protein's matrix (MA) domain. Prominent among MA-PM interactions is electrostatic attraction between the positively charged MA domain and the negatively charged plasma membrane inner leaflet. Previously, we reported that membrane association of HIV-1 Gag, as well as purified Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) MA and Gag, depends strongly on the presence of acidic lipids and is enhanced by cholesterol (Chol). The mechanism underlying this enhancement was unclear. Here, using a broad set of in vitro and in silico techniques we addressed molecular mechanisms of association between RSV MA and model membranes, and investigated how Chol enhances this association. In neutron scattering experiments with liposomes in the presence or absence of Chol, MA preferentially interacted with preexisting POPS-rich clusters formed by nonideal lipid mixing, binding peripherally to the lipid headgroups with minimal perturbation to the bilayer structure. Molecular dynamics simulations showed a stronger MA-bilayer interaction in the presence of Chol, and a large Chol-driven increase in lipid packing and membrane surface charge density. Although in vitro MA-liposome association is influenced by disparate variables, including ionic strength and concentrations of Chol and charged lipids, continuum electrostatic theory revealed an underlying dependence on membrane surface potential. Together, these results conclusively show that Chol affects RSV MA-membrane association by making the electrostatic potential at the membrane surface more negative, while decreasing the penalty for lipid headgroup desolvation. The presented approach can be applied to other viral and nonviral proteins.},[m

Translocation of DNA is a crucial step in nanopore-based sequencing platforms, where control over translocation speed remains one of the main challenges. Taking advantage of the interactions between negatively charged DNA and positively charged amino acid residues, the translocation speed of DNA can be manipulated by deliberate charge decorations inside the nanopore. We employed coarse-grained Langevin dynamics simulations to monitor the step-by-step movement of DNA through different mutations of $\alpha$-hemolysin protein nanopores. We found that although the average translocation time per nucleotide is longer, in agreement with experiments, the DNA nucleotides do not translocate with a uniform speed. Furthermore, the location and spacing of the charge decorations can alter the translocation dynamics significantly, trapping DNA in some cases. Our findings can give insights when designing charge patterns in nanopores.},[m

 abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have evolved a seven-transmembrane helix framework that is responsive to a wide range of extracellular signals. An analysis of the interior packing of family A GPCR crystal structures reveals two clusters of highly packed residues that facilitate tight transmembrane helix association. These clusters are centered on amino acid positions 2.47 and 4.53, which are highly conserved as alanine and serine, respectively. Ala2.47 mediates the interaction between helices H1 and H2, while Ser4.53 mediates the interaction between helices H3 and H4. The helical interfaces outside of these clusters are lined with residues that are more loosely packed, a structural feature that facilitates motion of helices H5, H6, and H7, which is required for receptor activation. Mutation of the conserved small side chain at position 4.53 within packing cluster 2 is shown to disrupt the structure of the visual receptor rhodopsin, whereas sites in packing cluster 1 (e.g., positions 1.46 and 2.47) are more tolerant to mutation but affect the overall stability of the protein. These findings reveal a common structural scaffold of GPCRs that is important for receptor folding and activation.},[m

 abstract = {A site-specific cross-linking approach was used to study the integration of TM (transmembrane) segments 4-7 of the polytopic membrane protein, opsin, at the ER (endoplasmic reticulum). We found that although TM4 exits the ER translocon rapidly, TM segments 5, 6 and 7 are all retained at the translocon until opsin biosynthesis is terminated. Furthermore, although artificial extension of the nascent chain is not sufficient to release the C-terminal region of opsin from the translocon, substitution of the native TM segment 7 with a more hydrophobic TM segment results in its rapid lateral exit into the lipid bilayer. We conclude that the intrinsic properties of a TM segment determine the timing of its membrane integration rather than its relative location within the polypeptide chain. A pronounced and prolonged association of opsin TM5 with the translocon-associated component PAT-10 was also observed, suggesting that PAT-10 may facilitate the assembly of distinct opsin subdomains during membrane integration. The results of the present study strongly support a model in which the ER translocon co-ordinates the integration of selected TM segments in response to the specific requirements of the precursor being synthesized.},[m

We find that location of cysteine at the amino terminus of an $\alpha$-helix, associated with activity in thioredoxins, is under-represented in human protein structures, perhaps indicative of selection against background reactivity. An amino-terminal helix location underpins the covalent linkage for one class of kinase inhibitors. Cysteine targets for S-palmitoylation, S-glutathionylation, and S-nitrosylation show little correlation with pKa values predicted from structures, although flanking sequences of S-palmitoylated sites are enriched in positively-charged amino acids, which could facilitate palmitoyl group transfer to substrate cysteine. A surprisingly large fraction of modified sites, across the three modifications, would be buried in native protein structure. Furthermore, modified cysteines are (on average) closer to lysine ubiquitinations than are unmodified cysteines, indicating that cysteine redox biology could be associated with protein degradation and degron recognition.},[m

As no current estimates exist for the number of membrane protein families, however, it is not possible to know whether family coverage is a realistic goal for membrane proteins. Here we find that virtually all polytopic helical membrane protein families are present in the already known sequences so we can make an estimate of the total number of families. We find that only approximately 700 polytopic membrane protein families account for 80{\%} of structured residues and approximately 1700 cover 90{\%} of structured residues. While apparently a finite and reachable goal, we estimate that it will likely take more than three decades to obtain the structures needed for 90{\%} residue coverage, if current trends continue.},[m

 abstract = {Hydrophobic amino acids are abundant in transmembrane (TM) helices of membrane proteins. Charged residues are sparse, apparently due to the unfavorable energetic cost of partitioning charges into nonpolar phases. Nevertheless, conserved arginine residues within TM helices regulate vital functions, such as ion channel voltage gating and integrin receptor inactivation. The energetic cost of arginine in various positions along hydrophobic helices has been controversial. Potential of mean force (PMF) calculations from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations predict very large energetic penalties, while in vitro experiments with Sec61 translocons indicate much smaller penalties, even for arginine in the center of hydrophobic TM helices. Resolution of this conflict has proved difficult, because the in vitro assay utilizes the complex Sec61 translocon, while the PMF calculations rely on the choice of simulation system and reaction coordinate. Here we present the results of computational and experimental studies that permit direct comparison with the Sec61 translocon results. We find that the Sec61 translocon mediates less efficient membrane insertion of Arg-containing TM helices compared with our computational and experimental bilayer-insertion results. In the simulations, a combination of arginine snorkeling, bilayer deformation, and peptide tilting is sufficient to lower the penalty of Arg insertion to an extent such that a hydrophobic TM helix with a central Arg residue readily inserts into a model membrane.

This study tested whether 4- and 5-year-olds (N=96) remain loyal to their group even when betraying it would be materially advantageous. Children and four puppets were allocated to novel groups. Two of these puppets (either in-group or out-group members) then told children a group secret and urged them not to disclose the secret. Another puppet (not assigned to either group) then bribed children with stickers to tell the secret. Across ages, children were significantly less likely to reveal the secret in the in-group condition than in the out-group condition. Thus, even young children are willing to pay a cost to be loyal to their group.},[m

 abstract = {Single pass transmembrane proteins make up almost half of the whole transmembrane proteome. Contacts between such bitopic transmembrane proteins are common, and oligomerization of their single transmembrane helix is involved in triggering and regulation of signal transduction across cell membranes. In several recent analyses the distribution of amino acids at helix-helix contact sides has been analyzed, and e.g. a preference of amino acids with small side chains has been identified. Here we select amino acids, amino acid pairings and amino acid motifs, which mediate strong interactions of single-span transmembrane $\alpha$-helices. Our analysis illustrates an architecture of TM helix dimers that is much more complex and diverse as might be expected from previous screens selecting homo-dimerizing TM helices. However, our findings are in excellent agreement with several previous computational analyses of existing transmembrane proteins and thus indicate that our screen nicely resembled the forces having guided evolution of transmembrane bundle structures. Furthermore, the results of this study indicate that helices do not per se have a strong propensity to interact via identical or highly similar helix surfaces, rather the geometries of two interacting helix surfaces “just” have to match to tightly pack and thereby form a stable transmembrane helix dimer. Finally, while evolution of transmembrane helix-helix interactions most likely was a compromise between formation of thermodynamically stable contact surfaces and protein function, our results suggest that “stability” was a major driving force during the evolution of $\alpha$-helical transmembrane proteins.},[m

The efficiency of membrane insertion depends on transmembrane (TM) helix amino acid composition, the helix length and the position of the amino acids within the helix. In this work, we conducted a computational analysis of the composition and location of amino acids in transmembrane helices found in membrane proteins of known structure to obtain an extensive set of designed polypeptide segments with naturally occurring amino acid distributions. Then, using an in vitro translation system in the presence of biological membranes, we experimentally validated our predictions by analyzing its membrane integration capacity.

 abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group. We report a comprehensive analysis of the numbers, lengths and amino acid compositions of transmembrane helices in 235 high-resolution structures of integral membrane proteins. The properties of 1551 transmembrane helices in the structures were compared with those obtained by analysis of the same amino acid sequences using topology prediction tools. Explanations for the 81 (5.2{\%}) missing or additional transmembrane helices in the prediction results were identified. Main reasons for missing transmembrane helices were mis-identification of N-terminal signal peptides, breaks in $\alpha$-helix conformation or charged residues in the middle of transmembrane helices and transmembrane helices with unusual amino acid composition. The main reason for additional transmembrane helices was mis-identification of amphipathic helices, extramembrane helices or hairpin re-entrant loops. Transmembrane helix length had an overall median of 24 residues and an average of 24.9 ± 7.0 residues and the most common length was 23 residues. The overall content of residues in transmembrane helices as a percentage of the full proteins had a median of 56.8{\%} and an average of 55.7 ± 16.0{\%}. Amino acid composition was analysed for the full proteins, transmembrane helices and extramembrane regions. Individual proteins or types of proteins with transmembrane helices containing extremes in contents of individual amino acids or combinations of amino acids with similar physicochemical properties were identified and linked to structure and/or function. In addition to overall median and average values, all results were analysed for proteins originating from different types of organism (prokaryotic, eukaryotic, viral) and for subgroups of receptors, channels, transporters and others.},[m

 abstract = {Structural genomics projects as well as ab initio protein structure prediction methods provide structures of proteins with no sequence or fold similarity to proteins with known functions. These are often low-resolution structures that may only include the positions of C$\alpha$atoms. We present a fast and efficient method to predict DNA-binding proteins from just the amino acid sequences and low-resolution, C$\alpha$-only protein models. The method uses the relative proportions of certain amino acids in the protein sequence, the asymmetry of the spatial distribution of certain other amino acids as well as the dipole moment of the molecule. These quantities are used in a linear formula, with coefficients derived from logistic regression performed on a training set, and DNA-binding is predicted based on whether the result is above a certain threshold. We show that the method is insensitive to errors in the atomic coordinates and provides correct predictions even on inaccurate protein models. We demonstrate that the method is capable of predicting proteins with novel binding site motifs and structures solved in an unbound state. The accuracy of our method is close to another, published method that uses all-atom structures, time-consuming calculations and information on conserved residues. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {Accurate prediction of DNA-binding residues has become a problem of increasing importance in structural bioinformatics. Here, we presented DNABind, a novel hybrid algorithm for identifying these crucial residues by exploiting the complementarity between machine learning- and template-based methods. Our machine learning-based method was based on the probabilistic combination of a structure-based and a sequence-based predictor, both of which were implemented using support vector machines algorithms. The former included our well-designed structural features, such as solvent accessibility, local geometry, topological features, and relative positions, which can effectively quantify the difference between DNA-binding and nonbinding residues. The latter combined evolutionary conservation features with three other sequence attributes. Our template-based method depended on structural alignment and utilized the template structure from known protein-DNA complexes to infer DNA-binding residues. We showed that the template method had excellent performance when reliable templates were found for the query proteins but tended to be strongly influenced by the template quality as well as the conformational changes upon DNA binding. In contrast, the machine learning approach yielded better performance when high-quality templates were not available (about 1/3 cases in our dataset) or the query protein was subject to intensive transformation changes upon DNA binding. Our extensive experiments indicated that the hybrid approach can distinctly improve the performance of the individual methods for both bound and unbound structures. DNABind also significantly outperformed the state-of-art algorithms by around 10{\%} in terms of Matthews's correlation coefficient. The proposed methodology could also have wide application in various protein functional site annotations. DNABind is freely available at http://mleg.cse.sc.edu/DNABind/.

The scale is based on measurements of helix propensity in 11 systems, including both proteins and peptides.

Papers rarely included scatterplots, box plots, and histograms that allow readers to critically evaluate continuous data. Most papers presented continuous data in bar and line graphs. This is problematic, as many different data distributions can lead to the same bar or line graph. The full data may suggest different conclusions from the summary statistics. We recommend training investigators in data presentation, encouraging a more complete presentation of data, and changing journal editorial policies.

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Membrane proteins form key nodes in mediating the cell's interaction with the surroundings, which is one of the main reasons why the majority of drug targets are membrane proteins. RESULTS: Here we mined the human proteome and identified the membrane proteome subset using three prediction tools for alpha-helices: Phobius, TMHMM, and SOSUI. This dataset was reduced to a non-redundant set by aligning it to the human genome and then clustered with our own interactive implementation of the ISODATA algorithm. The genes were classified and each protein group was manually curated, virtually evaluating each sequence of the clusters, applying systematic comparisons with a range of databases and other resources. We identified 6,718 human membrane proteins and classified the majority of them into 234 families of which 151 belong to the three major functional groups: receptors (63 groups, 1,352 members), transporters (89 groups, 817 members) or enzymes (7 groups, 533 members). Also, 74 miscellaneous groups with 697 members were determined. Interestingly, we find that 41{\%} of the membrane proteins are singlets with no apparent affiliation or identity to any human protein family. Our results identify major differences between the human membrane proteome and the ones in unicellular organisms and we also show a strong bias towards certain membrane topologies for different functional classes: 77{\%} of all transporters have more than six helices while 60{\%} of proteins with an enzymatic function and 88{\%} receptors, that are not GPCRs, have only one single membrane spanning alpha-helix. Further, we have identified and characterized new gene families and novel members of existing families. CONCLUSION: Here we present the most detailed roadmap of gene numbers and families to our knowledge, which is an important step towards an overall classification of the entire human proteome. We estimate that 27{\%} of the total human proteome are alpha-helical transmembrane proteins and provide an extended classification together with in-depth investigations of the membrane proteome's functional, structural, and evolutionary features.},[m

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physicochemical properties are frequently analyzed to characterize protein-sequences of known and unknown function. Especially the hydrophobicity of amino acids is often used for structural prediction or for the detection of membrane associated or embedded beta-sheets and alpha-helices. For this purpose many scales classifying amino acids according to their physicochemical properties have been defined over the past decades. In parallel, several hydrophobicity parameters have been defined for calculation of peptide properties. We analyzed the performance of separating sequence pools using 98 hydrophobicity scales and five different hydrophobicity parameters, namely the overall hydrophobicity, the hydrophobic moment for detection of the alpha-helical and beta-sheet membrane segments, the alternating hydrophobicity and the exact ss-strand score. RESULTS: Most of the scales are capable of discriminating between transmembrane alpha-helices and transmembrane beta-sheets, but assignment of peptides to pools of soluble peptides of different secondary structures is not achieved at the same quality. The separation capacity as measure of the discrimination between different structural elements is best by using the five different hydrophobicity parameters, but addition of the alternating hydrophobicity does not provide a large benefit. An in silico evolutionary approach shows that scales have limitation in separation capacity with a maximal threshold of 0.6 in general. We observed that scales derived from the evolutionary approach performed best in separating the different peptide pools when values for arginine and tyrosine were largely distinct from the value of glutamate. Finally, the separation of secondary structure pools via hydrophobicity can be supported by specific detectable patterns of four amino acids. CONCLUSION: It could be assumed that the quality of separation capacity of a certain scale depends on the spacing of the hydrophobicity value of certain amino acids. Irrespective of the wealth of hydrophobicity scales a scale separating all different kinds of secondary structures or between soluble and transmembrane peptides does not exist reflecting that properties other than hydrophobicity affect secondary structure formation as well. Nevertheless, application of hydrophobicity scales allows distinguishing between peptides with transmembrane alpha-helices and beta-sheets. Furthermore, the overall separation capacity score of 0.6 using different hydrophobicity parameters could be assisted by pattern search on the protein sequence level for specific peptides with a length of four amino acids.},[m

 abstract = {Like all cellular proteins, membrane proteins are synthesized by ribosomes. But unlike their soluble counterparts, highly hydrophobic membrane proteins require auxiliary machineries to prevent aggregation in aqueous cellular compartments. The principal machine is the translocon, which works in concert with ribosomes to manage the orderly insertion of alpha-helical membrane proteins directly into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of eukaryotes or into the plasma membrane of bacteria. In the course of insertion, membrane proteins come into thermodynamic equilibrium with the lipid membrane, where physicochemical interactions determine the final three-dimensional structure. Much progress has been made during the past several years toward understanding the physical chemistry of membrane protein stability, the structure of the translocon machine, and the mechanisms by which the translocon selects and inserts transmembrane helices. We review this progress and consider the connection between the physical principles of membrane protein stability and translocon selection of transmembrane helices.},[m

 abstract = {Although hydrophobic interaction is the main contributing factor to the stability of the protein fold, the specificity of the folding process depends on many directional interactions. An analysis has been carried out on the geometry of interaction between planar moieties of ten side chains (Phe, Tyr, Trp, His, Arg, Pro, Asp, Glu, Asn and Gln), the aromatic residues and the sulfide planes (of Met and cystine), and the aromatic residues and the peptide planes within the protein tertiary structures available in the Protein Data Bank. The occurrence of hydrogen bonds and other nonconventional interactions such as C-H⋯$\pi$, C-H⋯O, electrophile-nucleophile interactions involving the planar moieties has been elucidated. The specific nature of the interactions constraints many of the residue pairs to occur with a fixed sequence difference, maintaining a sequential order, when located in secondary structural elements, such as $\alpha$-helices and $\beta$-turns. The importance of many of these interactions (for example, aromatic residues interacting with Pro or cystine sulfur atom) is revealed by the higher degree of conservation observed for them in protein structures and binding regions. The planar residues are well represented in the active sites, and the geometry of their interactions does not deviate from the general distribution. The geometrical relationship between interacting residues provides valuable insights into the process of protein folding and would be useful for the design of protein molecules and modulation of their binding properties. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {Hydrophobic mismatch arises from a difference in the hydrophobic thickness of a lipid membrane and a transmembrane protein segment, and is thought to play an important role in the folding, stability and function of membrane proteins. We have investigated the possible adaptations that lipid bilayers and transmembrane $\alpha$-helices undergo in response to mismatch, using fully-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations totaling 1.4 $\mu$s. We have created 25 different tryptophan-alanine-leucine transmembrane $\alpha$-helical peptide systems, each composed of a hydrophobic alanine-leucine stretch, flanked by 1-4 tryptophan side chains, as well as the $\beta$-helical peptide dimer, gramicidin A. Membrane responses to mismatch include changes in local bilayer thickness and lipid order, varying systematically with peptide length. Adding more flanking tryptophan side chains led to an increase in bilayer thinning for negatively mismatched peptides, though it was also associated with a spreading of the bilayer interface. Peptide tilting, bending and stretching were systematic, with tilting dominating the responses, with values of up to {\~{}} 45 for the most positively mismatched peptides. Peptide responses were modulated by the number of tryptophan side chains due to their anchoring roles and distributions around the helices. Potential of mean force calculations for local membrane thickness changes, helix tilting, bending and stretching revealed that membrane deformation is the least energetically costly of all mismatch responses, except for positively mismatched peptides where helix tilting also contributes substantially. This comparison of energetic driving forces of mismatch responses allows for deeper insight into protein stability and conformational changes in lipid membranes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {Motivation: The translocon recognises sufficiently hydrophobic regions of a protein and inserts them into the membrane. Computational methods try to determine what hydrophobic regions are recognised by the translocon. Although these predictions are quite accurate, many methods still fail to distinguish marginally hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) helices and equally hydrophobic regions in soluble protein domains. In vivo, this problem is most likely avoided by targeting of the TM-proteins, so that non-TM proteins never see the translocon. Proteins are targeted to the translocon by a N-terminal signal peptide. The targeting is also aided by the fact that the N-terminal helix is more hydrophobic than other TM-helices. In addition we also recently found that the C-terminal helix is more hydrophobic than central helices. This information has not been used in earlier topology predictors. Results: Here, we use the fact that the N- and C-terminal helices are more hydrophobic to develop a new version of the first-principle- based topology predictor, SCAMPI. The new predictor has two main advantages; firstly, it can be used to efficiently separate membrane and non-membrane proteins directly without the use of an extra prefilter, and secondly it shows improved performance for predicting the topology of membrane proteins that contain large non-membrane domains.},[m

 abstract = {We have studied the effects of single charged residues on the position of a model transmembrane helix in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane using the glycosylation mapping technique. Asp and Glu residues cause a re-positioning of the C-terminal end of the transmembrane helix when placed in the one to two C-terminal turns but not when placed more centrally. Arg and Lys residues, in contrast, have little effect when placed in the two C-terminal turn but give rise to a more substantial shift in position when placed 9-11 residues from the helix end. We suggest that this difference between the effects of positively and negatively charged residues can be explained by the so-called snorkel effect, i.e. that the very long side-chains of Arg and Lys can reach up along the transmembrane helix to allow the terminal, charged moiety to reside in the lipid headgroup region while the C($\alpha$) of the residue is positioned well below the membrane/water interface.},[m

 abstract = {The ability of hydrophilic residues to shift the transverse position of transmembrane (TM) helices within bilayers was studied in model membrane vesicles. Transverse shifts were detected by fluorescence measurements of the membrane depth of a Trp residue at the center of a hydrophobic sequence. They were also estimated from the effective length of the TM-spanning sequence, derived from the stability of the TM configuration under conditions of negative hydrophobic mismatch. Hydrophilic residues (at the fifth position in a 21-residue hydrophobic sequence composed of alternating Leu and Ala residues and flanked on both ends by two Lys) induced transverse shifts that moved the hydrophilic residue closer to the membrane surface. At pH 7, the dependence of the extent of shift upon the identity of the hydrophilic residue increased in the order: L {\textless} G∼Y∼T {\textless} R∼H {\textless} S {\textless} P {\textless} K {\textless} E∼Q {\textless} N {\textless} D. By varying pH, shifts with ionizable residues fully charged or uncharged were measured, and the extent of shift increased in the order: L {\textless} G∼Y∼Ho∼T {\textless} Eo∼R {\textless} S {\textless} P {\textless} K+{\textless} Q∼Do∼H+{\textless} N∼E-{\textless} D-. The dependence of transverse shifts upon hydrophilic residue identity was consistent with the hypothesis that shift magnitude is largely controlled by the combination of side chain hydrophilicity, ionization state, and ability to position polar groups near the bilayer surface (snorkeling). Additional experiments showed that shift was also modulated by the position of the hydrophilic residue in the sequence and the hydrophobicity of the sequence moved out of the bilayer core upon shifting. Combined, these studies show that the insertion boundaries of TM helices are very sensitive to sequence, and can be altered even by weakly hydrophilic residues. Thus, many TM helices may have the capacity to exist in more than one transverse position. Knowledge of the magnitudes of transverse shifts induced by different hydrophilic residues should be useful for design of mutagenesis studies measuring the effect of transverse TM helix position upon function. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {Advances in structure determination of membrane proteins enable analysis of the propensities of amino acids in extramembrane versus transmembrane locations to be performed on the basis of structure rather than of sequence and predicted topology. Using 29 available structures of integral membrane proteins with resolutions better than 4 {\AA} the distributions of amino acids in the transmembrane domains were calculated. The results were compared to analysis based on just the sequences of the same transmembrane $\alpha$-helices and significant differences were found. The distribution of residues between transmembrane $\alpha$-helices and $\beta$-strands was also compared. Large hydrophobic (Phe, Leu, Ile, Val) residues showed a clear preference for the protein surfaces facing the lipids for $\beta$-barrels, but in $\alpha$-helical proteins no such preference was seen, with these residues equally distributed between the interior and the surface of the protein. A notable exception to this was alanine, which showed a slight preference for the interior of $\alpha$-helical membrane proteins. Aromatic residues were found to follow saddle-like distributions preferring to be located in the lipid/water interfaces. The resultant 'aromatic belts' were spaced more closely for $\beta$-barrel than for $\alpha$-helical membrane proteins. Charged residues could be shown to generally avoid surfaces facing the bilayer although they were found to occur frequently in the transmembrane region of $\beta$-barrels. Indeed detailed comparison between $\alpha$-helical and $\beta$-barrel proteins showed many qualitative differences in residue distributions. This suggests that there may be subtle differences in the factors stabilising $\beta$-barrels in bacterial outer membranes and $\alpha$-helix bundles in all other membranes. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},[m

 abstract = {The integration of transmembrane (TM)-spanning regions of many channels and ion transporters is potentially compromised by the presence of polar and charged residues required for biological function. Although the two TMs of the ATP-gated ion channel subunit P2X2 each contain charged/polar amino acids, we found that each TM is efficiently membrane inserted when it is analysed in isolation, and uncovered no evidence for cooperativity between these two TMs during P2X2 integration. However, using minimal N-glycosylation distance mapping, we find that the positioning of TM2 in newly synthesized P2X2 monomers is distinct from that seen in subunits of the high-resolution structures of assembled homologous trimers. We conclude that P2X2 monomers are initially synthesised at the endoplasmic reticulum in a distinct conformation, where the extent of the TM-spanning regions is primarily defined by the thermodynamic cost of their membrane integration at the Sec61 translocon. In this model, TM2 of P2X2 subsequently undergoes a process of positional editing within the membrane that correlates with trimerisation of the monomer, a process requiring specific polar/charged residues in both TM1 and TM2. We postulate that the assembly process offsets any energetic cost of relocating TM2, and find evidence that positional editing of TM2 in the acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC1a) is even more pronounced than that observed for P2X2. Taken together, these data further underline the potential complexities involved in accurately predicting TM domains. We propose that the orchestrated repositioning of TM segments during subunit oligomerisation plays an important role in generating the functional architecture of active ion channels, and suggest that the regulation of this underappreciated biosynthetic step may provide an elegant mechanism for maintaining ER homeostasis.},[m

A. 86, 5786-5790), which asserts that the topology of a eucaryotic multispanning membrane protein is determined solely by the amino acid charge difference across the first transmembrane segment. The charge difference across the first transmembrane segment of Glut1 was progressively inverted in two independent series of mutants, one series in which only the number of positively charged amino acid residues in the two flanking domains was altered and the other in which only the number of negatively charged residues in the two flanking domains was changed. The results indicate that the charge difference across the first transmembrane segment does affect the topology of the protein, but that contrary to the hypothesis, it only dictates the orientation of the first transmembrane segment and the disposition of the amino terminus and the first linker domain. Charge inversion resulted in the formation of aberrant molecules in which either the first or second transmembrane segment failed to insert into the membrane. The topology of downstream regions of Glut1 was unaffected by charge inversion across the first transmembrane segment, indicating that downstream sequences are important in determining the local topological disposition of the molecule.},[m

 abstract = {Transmembrane helical segments (TMs) can be classified into two groups of so-called 'simple' and 'complex' TMs. Whereas the first group represents mere hydrophobic anchors with an overrepresentation of aliphatic hydrophobic residues that are likely attributed to convergent evolution in many cases, the complex ones embody ancestral information and tend to have structural and functional roles beyond just membrane immersion. Hence, the sequence homology concept is not applicable on simple TMs. In practice, these simple TMs can attract statistically significant but evolutionarily unrelated hits during similarity searches (whether through BLAST- or HMM-based approaches). This is especially problematic for membrane proteins that contain both globular segments and TMs. As such, we have developed the transmembrane helix: simple or complex (TMSOC) webserver for the identification of simple and complex TMs. By masking simple TM segments in seed sequences prior to sequence similarity searches, the false-discovery rate decreases without sacrificing sensitivity. Therefore, TMSOC is a novel and necessary sequence analytic tool for both the experimentalists and the computational biology community working on membrane proteins.

In this work, we conducted a large-scale analysis of the prevalent locations of amino acids by using a data set of 170 structures of integral membrane proteins obtained from the MPtopo database and 930 structures of water-soluble helical proteins obtained from the protein data bank. Large hydrophobic amino acids (Leu, Val, Ile, and Phe) plus Gly were clearly prevalent in TM helices whereas polar amino acids (Glu, Lys, Asp, Arg, and Gln) were less frequent in this type of helix. The distribution of amino acids along TM helices was also examined. As expected, hydrophobic and slightly polar amino acids are commonly found in the hydrophobic core of the membrane whereas aromatic (Trp and Tyr), Pro, and the hydrophilic amino acids (Asn, His, and Gln) occur more frequently in the interface regions. Charged amino acids are also statistically prevalent outside the hydrophobic core of the membrane, and whereas acidic amino acids are frequently found at both cytoplasmic and extra-cytoplasmic interfaces, basic amino acids cluster at the cytoplasmic interface. These results strongly support the experimentally demonstrated biased distribution of positively charged amino acids (that is, the so-called the positive-inside rule) with structural data.},[m

 abstract = {Zn(2+) plays essential roles in biology, and cells have adopted exquisite mechanisms for regulating steady-state Zn(2+) levels. Although much is known about total Zn(2+) in cells, very little is known about its subcellular distribution. Yet defining the location of Zn(2+) and how it changes with signaling events is essential for elucidating how cells regulate this essential ion. Here we create fluorescent sensors genetically targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi to monitor steady-state Zn(2+) levels as well as flux of Zn(2+) into and out of these organelles. These studies reveal that ER and Golgi contain a concentration of free Zn(2+) that is 100 times lower than the cytosol. Both organelles take up Zn(2+) when cytosolic levels are elevated, suggesting that the ER and Golgi can sequester elevated cytosolic Zn(2+) and thus have the potential to play a role in influencing Zn(2+) toxicity. ER Zn(2+) homeostasis is perturbed by small molecule antagonists of Ca(2+) homeostasis and ER Zn(2+) is released upon elevation of cytosolic Ca(2+) pointing to potential exchange of these two ions across the ER. This study provides direct evidence that Ca(2+) signaling can influence Zn(2+) homeostasis and vice versa, that Zn(2+) dynamics may modulate Ca(2+) signaling.},[m

Although it has long been known that an abundance of nonpolar residues in transmembrane helices is the principal criterion for membrane insertion, the specific sequence-coding for transmembrane helices has not been identified. By challenging the endoplasmic reticulum Sec61 translocon with an extensive set of designed polypeptide segments, we have determined the basic features of this code, including a 'biological' hydrophobicity scale. We find that membrane insertion depends strongly on the position of polar residues within transmembrane segments, adding a new dimension to the problem of predicting transmembrane helices from amino acid sequences.

 abstract = {Motivation: UniRef databases provide full-scale clustering of UniProtKB sequences and are utilized for a broad range of applications, particularly similarity-based functional annotation. Non-redundancy and intra-cluster homogeneity in UniRef were recently improved by adding a sequence length overlap threshold. Our hypothesis is that these improvements would enhance the speed and sensitivity of similarity searches and improve the consistency of annotation within clusters.$\backslash$nResults: Intra-cluster molecular function consistency was examined by analysis of Gene Ontology terms. Results show that UniRef clusters bring together proteins of identical molecular function in more than 97{\%} of the clusters, implying that clusters are useful for annotation and can also be used to detect annotation inconsistencies. To examine coverage in similarity results, BLASTP searches against UniRef50 followed by expansion of the hit lists with cluster members demonstrated advantages compared with searches against UniProtKB sequences; the searches are concise (∼7 times shorter hit list before expansion), faster (∼6 times) and more sensitive in detection of remote similarities ({\textgreater}96{\%} recall at e-value {\textless}0.0001). Our results support the use of UniRef clusters as a comprehensive and scalable alternative to native sequence databases for similarity searches and reinforces its reliability for use in functional annotation.$\backslash$nAvailability and implementation: Web access and file download from UniProt website at http://www.uniprot.org/uniref and ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/uniref.

However, other structural elements, as yet largely ignored in statistical studies of membrane protein structure, are found in those parts of the protein that are located in the membrane-water interface region. Here, we show that this region is enriched in irregular structure and in interfacial helices running roughly parallel with the membrane surface, while $\beta$-strands are extremely rare. The average amino acid composition is different between the interfacial helices, the parts of the transmembrane helices located in the interface region, and the irregular structures. In this region, hydrophobic and aromatic residues tend to point toward the membrane and charged/polar residues tend to point away from the membrane. The interface region thus imposes different constraints on protein structure than do the central hydrocarbon core of the membrane and the surrounding aqueous phase. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Compact globular structures in protein molecules are shown to be determined by amino acid sequences of high informational complexity. Sequences of known crystal structure in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank differ only slightly from randomly shuffled sequences in the distribution of statistical properties such as local compositional complexity. In contrast, in the much larger body of deduced sequences in the SWISS-PROT database, approximately one quarter of the residues occur in segments of non-randomly low complexity and approximately half of the entries contain at least one such segment. Sequences of proteins with known, physicochemically-defined non-globular regions have been analyzed, including collagens, different classes of coiled-coil proteins, elastins, histones, non-histone proteins, mucins, proteoglycan core proteins and proteins containing long single solvent-exposed alpha-helices. The SEG algorithm provides an effective general method for partitioning the globular and non-globular regions of these sequences fully automatically. This method is also facilitating the discovery of new classes of long, non-globular sequence segments, as illustrated by the example of the human CAN gene product involved in tumor induction. {\textcopyright} 1994.},[m

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sequence homology considerations widely used to transfer functional annotation to uncharacterized protein sequences require special precautions in the case of non-globular sequence segments including membrane-spanning stretches composed of non-polar residues. Simple, quantitative criteria are desirable for identifying transmembrane helices (TMs) that must be included into or should be excluded from start sequence segments in similarity searches aimed at finding distant homologues.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We found that there are two types of TMs in membrane-associated proteins. On the one hand, there are so-called simple TMs with elevated hydrophobicity, low sequence complexity and extraordinary enrichment in long aliphatic residues. They merely serve as membrane-anchoring device. In contrast, so-called complex TMs have lower hydrophobicity, higher sequence complexity and some functional residues. These TMs have additional roles besides membrane anchoring such as intra-membrane complex formation, ligand binding or a catalytic role. Simple and complex TMs can occur both in single- and multi-membrane-spanning proteins essentially in any type of topology. Whereas simple TMs have the potential to confuse searches for sequence homologues and to generate unrelated hits with seemingly convincing statistical significance, complex TMs contain essential evolutionary information.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: For extending the homology concept onto membrane proteins, we provide a necessary quantitative criterion to distinguish simple TMs (and a sufficient criterion for complex TMs) in query sequences prior to their usage in homology searches based on assessment of hydrophobicity and sequence complexity of the TM sequence segments.},[m

 abstract = {▪ Abstract Stably folded membrane proteins reside in a free energy minimum determined by the interactions of the peptide chains with each other, the lipid bilayer hydrocarbon core, the bilayer interface, and with water. The prediction of three-dimensional structure from sequence requires a detailed understanding of these interactions. Progress toward this objective is summarized in this review by means of a thermodynamic framework for describing membrane protein folding and stability. The framework includes a coherent thermodynamic formalism for determining and describing the energetics of peptide-bilayer interactions and a review of the properties of the environment of membrane proteins—the bilayer milieu. Using a four-step thermodynamic cycle as a guide, advances in three main aspects of membrane protein folding energetics are discussed: protein binding and folding in bilayer interfaces, transmembrane helix insertion, and helix-helix interactions. The concepts of membrane protein stability that emerge p...},[m

Twenty to 30{\%} of all ORFs are predicted to encode membrane proteins, with the larger genomes containing a higher fraction than the smaller ones. Although there is a general tendency that proteins with a smaller number of transmembrane segments are more prevalent than those with many, uni-cellular organisms appear to prefer proteins with 6 and 12 transmembrane segments, whereas Caenorhabditis elegans and Homo sapiens have a slight preference for proteins with seven transmembrane segments. In all organisms, there is a tendency that membrane proteins either have many transmembrane segments with short connecting loops or few transmembrane segments with large extra-membraneous domains. Membrane proteins from all organisms studied, except possibly the archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii, follow the so-called "positive-inside" rule; i.e., they tend to have a higher frequency of positively charged residues in cytoplasmic than in extra-cytoplasmic segments.},[m

 abstract = {How complex cytoplasmic membrane proteins insert and fold into cellular membranes is not fully understood. One problem is the lack of suitable approaches that allow investigating the process by which polypeptides insert and fold into membranes. Here, we introduce a method to mechanically unfold and extract a single polytopic $\alpha$-helical membrane protein, the lactose permease (LacY), from a phospholipid membrane, transport the fully unfolded polypeptide to another membrane and insert and refold the polypeptide into the native structure. Insertion and refolding of LacY is facilitated by the transmembrane chaperone/insertase YidC in the absence of the SecYEG translocon. Insertion into the membrane occurs in a stepwise, stochastic manner employing multiple coexisting pathways to complete the folding process. We anticipate that our approach will provide new means of studying the insertion and folding of membrane proteins and to mechanically reconstitute membrane proteins at high spatial precision and stoichiometric control, thus allowing the functional programming of synthetic and biological membranes. KEYWORDS: Membrane protein insertion and folding, folding pathway, mechanical reconstitution, single-molecule force spectroscopy, YidC insertase, atomic force microscopy I n vivo the folding of cytoplasmic membrane proteins occurs in the context of vectorial translation of the freshly synthesized polypeptide, which exits the ribosome with its N-terminal end. 1−6 However, translation is slow compared to folding, and it takes ribosomes between ∼5 s (bacteria) and ∼25 s (eukaryotes) to synthesize a 100 amino acid (aa) long protein. 7,8 Accordingly, the biogenesis of most polytopic membrane proteins depends critically on cotranslational insertion and folding in the cytoplasmic membrane, which is facilitated by ribosome−translocon-insertase complexes. 4−6,9},[m

 abstract = {The conserved SecYEG protein-conducting channel and the accessory proteins SecDF-YajC and YidC constitute the bacterial holo-translocon (HTL), capable of protein-secretion and membrane-protein insertion. By employing an integrative approach combining small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), low-resolution electron microscopy and biophysical analyses we determined the arrangement of the proteins and lipids within the super-complex. The results guided the placement of X-ray structures of individual HTL components and allowed the proposal of a model of the functional translocon. Their arrangement around a central lipid-containing pool conveys an unexpected, but compelling mechanism for membrane-protein insertion. The periplasmic domains of YidC and SecD are poised at the protein-channel exit-site of SecY, presumably to aid the emergence of translocating polypeptides. The SecY lateral gate for membrane-insertion is adjacent to the membrane 'insertase' YidC. Absolute-scale SANS employing a novel contrast-match-point analysis revealed a dynamic complex adopting open and compact configurations around an adaptable central lipid-filled chamber, wherein polytopic membrane-proteins could fold, sheltered from aggregation and proteolysis.},[m

 abstract = {Molecular structures and sequences are generally more revealing of evolutionary relationships than are classical phenotypes (particularly so among microorganisms). Consequently, the basis for the definition of taxa has progressively shifted from the organismal to the cellular to the molecular level. Molecular comparisons show that life on this planet divides into three primary groupings, commonly known as the eubacteria, the archaebacteria, and the eukaryotes. The three are very dissimilar, the differences that separate them being of a more profound nature than the differences that separate typical kingdoms, such as animals and plants. Unfortunately, neither of the conventionally accepted views of the natural relationships among living systems--i.e., the five-kingdom taxonomy or the eukaryote-prokaryote dichotomy--reflects this primary tripartite division of the living world. To remedy this situation we propose that a formal system of organisms be established in which above the level of kingdom there exists a new taxon called a "domain." Life on this planet would then be seen as comprising three domains, the Bacteria, the Archaea, and the Eucarya, each containing two or more kingdoms. (The Eucarya, for example, contain Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, and a number of others yet to be defined). Although taxonomic structure within the Bacteria and Eucarya is not treated herein, Archaea is formally subdivided into the two kingdoms Euryarchaeota (encompassing the methanogens and their phenotypically diverse relatives) and Crenarchaeota (comprising the relatively tight clustering of extremely thermophilic archaebacteria, whose general phenotype appears to resemble most the ancestral phenotype of the Archaea.},[m

To examine the composition of the native lipid environment in the vicinity of the SecYEG complex and its impact on translocation activity, styrene-maleic acid lipid particles (SMALPs) were used to extract SecYEG with its lipid environment directly from native Escherichia coli membranes without the use of detergents. This allowed the co-extraction of SecYEG in complex with SecA, but not with SecDFyajC or YidC. Lipid analysis of the SecYEG-SMALPs revealed an enrichment of negatively charged lipids in the vicinity of SecYEG, which in detergent assisted reconstitution of the Sec translocase are crucial for the translocation activity. Such lipid enrichment was not found with separately extracted SecDFyajC or YidC, which demonstrates a specific interaction between SecYEG and negatively charged lipids.},[m

 abstract = {Glycophorin, the major sialoglycoprotein of the human erythrocyte membrane, is composed of 131 amino acids and an average of 16 oligosaccharide chains. Fifteen oligosaccharides are linked to threonine/serine residues via O-glycosidic bonds, and one more complex unit is attached to asparagine. The location of each of these oligosaccharides and the complete amino-acid sequence of this molecular have been determined by Edman degradation techniques. Glycophorin appears to be organized into three distinct "domains" on the basis of the locations of glycosylated amino acids and the clustering of residues of similar type. These include (i) a glycosylated segment composed of approximately 64 residues from the NH2-terminus, (ii) a "hydrophobic" segment of approximately 32 nonpolar residues, and (iii) a COOH-terminal segment, composed of approximately 35 residues, which has an unusual concentration of hydrophilic amino acids. This unique structure is consistent with the earlier suggestions that glycophorin is one of the major "intrinsic" membrane proteins which has a transmembrane orientation.},[m

Accordingly, this paper proposed a theoretical framework where, during the period of human evolution, same-sex attractions in women were under positive selection. The source of positive selection has been male preferences for opposite-sex sex partners who experienced same-sex attractions. This theoretical framework was used to generate four predictions that were tested in two online studies which employed a total of 1509 heterosexual participants. It was found that heterosexual women did not desire partners who experienced same-sex attractions, but a considerable proportion of heterosexual men desired partners who experienced same-sex attractions. In addition, it was found that men were more sexually excited than women by the same-sex infidelity of their partners, and they desired more than women, their opposite-sex partners to have sex with same-sex individuals. Finally, participants' preferences were contingent on the seriousness of the relationships, with same-sex attraction to be preferred more in short-term than in a long-term partner. These findings were employed in understanding the evolutionary origins of same-sex attraction in women.},[m

 abstract = {The structure of the first protein-conducting channelwas determinedmore than a decade ago. Today,we are still puzzled by the outstanding problemof protein translocation—the dynamic mechanism underlying the consignment of pro- teins across and into membranes. This review is an attempt to summarize and understand the energy transducing capabilities of protein-translocating machines, with emphasis on bacterial systems: how polypeptides make head- way against the lipid bilayer and how the process is coupled to the free energy associated with ATP hydrolysis and the transmembrane protein motive force. In order to explore how cargo is driven across the membrane, the known structures of the protein-translocation machines are set out against the background of the historic literature, and in the light of experiments con- ducted in their wake. The paper will focus on the bacterial general secretory (Sec) pathway (SecY-complex), and its eukaryotic counterpart (Sec61-complex), which ferry proteins across the membrane in an unfolded state, as well as the unrelated Tat system that assembles bespoke channels for the export of folded proteins.},[m

 abstract = {Membrane proteins are crucial in transport, signaling, bioenergetics, catalysis, and as drug targets. Here we show that membrane proteins have dramatically fewer detectable orthologs than watersoluble proteins, less than half in most species analyzed. This sparse distribution could reflect rapid divergence or gene loss. We find that both mechanisms operate. First, membrane proteins evolve faster than watersoluble proteins, particularly in their exteriorfacing portions. Second, we demonstrate that predicted ancestral membrane proteins are preferentially lost compared with watersoluble proteins in closely related species of archaea and bacteria. These patterns are consistent across the whole tree of life, and in each of the three domains of archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. Our findings point to a fundamental evolutionary principle: membrane proteins evolve faster due to stronger adaptive selection in changing environments, while cytosolic proteins are under more stringent purifying selection in the homeostatic interior of the cell. This effect should be strongest in prokaryotes, weaker in unicellular eukaryotes (with intracellular membranes), and weakest in multicellular eukaryotes (with extracellular homeostasis). We demonstrate that this is indeed the case. Similarly, we show that extracellular watersoluble proteins exhibit an even stronger pattern of low homology than membrane proteins. These striking differences in conservation of membrane proteins versus watersoluble proteins have important implications for evolution and medicine.},[m

However a number of features, the result of four decades of research, must be incorporated to obtain a valid, contemporary version of the model. Among the novel aspects to be considered are: (i) the high density of proteins in the bilayer, that makes the bilayer a molecularly "crowded" space, with important physiological consequences; (ii) the proteins that bind the membranes on a temporary basis, thus establishing a continuum between the purely soluble proteins, never in contact with membranes, and those who cannot exist unless bilayer-bound; (iii) the progress in our knowledge of lipid phases, the putative presence of non-lamellar intermediates in membranes, and the role of membrane curvature and its relation to lipid geometry, (iv) the existence of lateral heterogeneity (domain formation) in cell membranes, including the transient microdomains known as rafts, and (v) the possibility of transient and localized transbilayer (flip-flop) lipid motion.

This is in part due to improvements in algorithms and computing performance, but is also the result of the emergence of coarse-grained (CG) potentials, which complement and extend the information obtainable from fully detailed models. CG methods have already proven successful for a range of applications that benefit from the ability to rapidly simulate spontaneous self-assembly within a lipid membrane environment, including the insertion and/or oligomerization of a range of "toy models," transmembrane peptides, and single- and multi-domain proteins. While these simplified approaches sacrifice atomistic level detail, it is now straightforward to "reverse map" from CG to atomistic descriptions, providing a strategy to assemble membrane proteins within a lipid environment, prior to all-atom simulation. Moreover, recent developments have been made in "dual resolution" techniques, allowing different molecules in the system to be modeled with atomistic or CG resolution simultaneously.},[m

 abstract = {Soluble amphiphiles, or detergents, are known to produce a number of structural and dynamic effects on membranes, even at concentrations below those causing membrane solubilization (i.e. in the so-called stage I of detergent-membrane interaction). The main subsolubilizing detergent effects on membranes are transmembrane lipid motion (flip-flop), breakdown of the membrane permeability barrier (leakage), and vesicle lysis/reassembly. For a proper understanding of membrane solubilization by detergents, it is important to assess whether the various effects seen at subsolubilizing surfactant concentrations occur independently from each other or are interconnected by cause-effect relationships so that they can be interpreted as necessary steps in the overall process of solubilization. To answer this question, we have explored the three above-mentioned effects (i.e., flip-flop, leakage, and lysis/reassembly) apart from solubilization in model (large unilamellar vesicles) and cell (erythrocyte) membranes. Five structurally different surfactants, namely, chlorpromazine, imipramine, Triton X-100, sodium dodecylsulfate, and sodium deoxycholate have been used. Each of them behaves in a unique way. Our results reveal that lipid flip-flop, vesicle leakage, and vesicle lysis/reassembly occur independently between them and with respect to bilayer solubilization so that they cannot be considered to be necessary parts of a higher-order unified process of membrane solubilization by detergents.},[m

In order to examine the topology and function of the COOH-terminal mem-brane binding domain of cytochrome bs, mutants have been constructed, expressed, purified, and partially characterized. Pro-115 is located in the middle of the putative a-helical membrane-anchoring domain of cy-tochrome bg and has been hypothesized to give rise to either a hairpin-like loop or =26O kink in the helix, depending on whether it exists, respectively, in the cis or trans configuration. The Pro-115 + Ala mutant, which is expected to have a straight transmembrane helix, inserted normally into the endoplasmic reticu-lum and exhibited wild type levels of activity in yeast microsomes and in vitro in the cytochrome P-450 mixed function oxidation system. Since a hairpin struc-ture does not appear to be essential, it is likely that the membrane binding domain of cytochrome b g spans the membrane. Characterization of the truncated cytochrome b g molecule, Pro-115 + Stop, lacking 19 amino acids at the COOH terminus indicates that the distal part of the membrane binding domain of cytochrome bs is neces-sary for in vivo binding to the endoplasmic reticulum and for functioning with its membrane-associated elec-tron transfer partners. Replacement of Ser-104 to Met-125, the putative membrane-anchoring domain of cytochrome bg, with 22 leucine residues results in a protein which targets to the endoplasmic reticulum but the extent of its re-duction is only 50{\%} of that of the wild type in yeast microsomes.

[31m-abstract = {Biological membranes are essential for normal function and regulation of cells, forming a physical barrier between extracellular and intracellular space and cellular compartments. These physical barriers are subject to mechanical stresses. As a consequence, nature has developed proteins that are able to transpose mechanical stimuli into meaningful intracellular signals. These proteins, termed Mechanosensitive (MS) proteins provide a variety of roles in response to these stimuli. In prokaryotes these proteins form transmembrane spanning channels that function as osmotically activated nanovalves to prevent cell lysis by hypoosmotic shock. In eukaryotes, the function of MS proteins is more diverse and includes physiological processes such as touch, pain and hearing. The transmembrane portion of these channels is influenced by the physical properties such as charge, shape, thickness and stiffness of the lipid bilayer surrounding it, as well as the bilayer pressure profile. In this review we provide an overview of the progress to date on advances in our understanding of the intimate biophysical and chemical interactions between the lipid bilayer and mechanosensitive membrane channels, focusing on current progress in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems. These advances are of importance due to the increasing evidence of the role the MS channels play in disease, such as xerocytosis, muscular dystrophy and cardiac hypertrophy. Moreover, insights gained from lipid-protein interactions of MS channels are likely relevant not only to this class of membrane proteins, but other bilayer embedded proteins as well.

 abstract = {The molecular activity of Na,K-ATPase and other P2 ATPases like Ca{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2 +{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}-ATPase is influenced by the lipid environment via both general (physical) and specific (chemical) interactions. Whereas the general effects of bilayer structure on membrane protein function are fairly well described and understood, the importance of the specific interactions has only been realized within the last decade due particularly to the growing field of membrane protein crystallization, which has shed new light on the molecular details of specific lipid-protein interactions. It is a remarkable observation that specific lipid-protein interactions seem to be evolutionarily conserved, and conformations of specifically bound lipids at the lipid-protein surface within the membrane are similar in crystal structures determined with different techniques and sources of the protein, despite the rather weak lipid-protein interaction energy. Studies of purified detergent-soluble recombinant $\alpha$$\beta$ or $\alpha$$\beta$FXYD Na,K-ATPase complexes reveal three separate functional effects of phospholipids and cholesterol with characteristic structural selectivity. The observations suggest that these three effects are exerted at separate binding sites for phophatidylserine/cholesterol (stabilizing), polyunsaturated phosphatidylethanolamine (stimulatory), and saturated PC or sphingomyelin/cholesterol (inhibitory), which may be located within three lipid-binding pockets identified in recent crystal structures of Na,K-ATPase. The findings point to a central role of direct and specific interactions of different phospholipids and cholesterol in determining both stability and molecular activity of Na,K-ATPase and possible implications for physiological regulation by membrane lipid composition.

 abstract = {Binding of specific lipids to large, polytopic membrane proteins is well described, and it is clear that such lipids are crucial for protein stability and activity. In contrast, binding of defined lipid species to individual transmembrane helices and regulation of transmembrane helix monomer-oligomer equilibria by binding of distinct lipids is a concept, which has emerged only lately. Lipids bind to single-span membrane proteins, both in the juxta-membrane region as well as in the hydrophobic membrane core. While some interactions counteract transmembrane helix oligomerization, in other cases lipid binding appears to enhance oligomerization. As reversible oligomerization is involved in activation of many membrane proteins, binding of defined lipids to single-span transmembrane proteins might be a mechanism to regulate and/or fine-tune the protein activity. But how could lipid binding trigger the activity of a protein? How can binding of a single lipid molecule to a transmembrane helix affect the structure of a transmembrane helix oligomer, and consequently its signaling state? These questions are discussed in the present article based on recent results obtained with simple, single-span transmembrane proteins.

These physical barriers are subject to mechanical stresses. As a consequence, nature has developed proteins that are able to transpose mechanical stimuli into meaningful intracellular signals. These proteins, termed Mechanosensitive (MS) proteins provide a variety of roles in response to these stimuli. In prokaryotes these proteins form transmembrane spanning channels that function as osmotically activated nanovalves to prevent cell lysis by hypoosmotic shock. In eukaryotes, the function of MS proteins is more diverse and includes physiological processes such as touch, pain and hearing. The transmembrane portion of these channels is influenced by the physical properties such as charge, shape, thickness and stiffness of the lipid bilayer surrounding it, as well as the bilayer pressure profile. In this review we provide an overview of the progress to date on advances in our understanding of the intimate biophysical and chemical interactions between the lipid bilayer and mechanosensitive membrane channels, focusing on current progress in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems. These advances are of importance due to the increasing evidence of the role the MS channels play in disease, such as xerocytosis, muscular dystrophy and cardiac hypertrophy. Moreover, insights gained from lipid-protein interactions of MS channels are likely relevant not only to this class of membrane proteins, but other bilayer embedded proteins as well.

Using a total of 3 $\mu$s of molecular dynamics simulations for a library of hydrophobic WALP-like peptides, a long poly-Leu $\alpha$-helix, and the methyl-indole analog, we explore the thermodynamics of the Trp movement in membranes that governs the stability and orientation of transmembrane protein segments. We examine the dominant hydrogen-bonding interactions between the Trp and lipid carbonyl and phosphate moieties, cation-$\pi$ interactions to lipid choline moieties, and elucidate the contributions to the thermodynamics that serve to localize the Trp, by {\~{}} 4 kcal/mol, near the membrane glycerol backbone region. We show a striking similarity between the free energy to move an isolated Trp side chain to that found from a wide range of WALP peptides, suggesting that the location of this side chain is nearly independent of the host transmembrane segment. Our calculations provide quantitative measures that explain Trp's role as a modulator of responses to hydrophobic mismatch, providing a deeper understanding of how lipid composition may control a range of membrane active peptides and proteins. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {Protein-lipid interaction and bilayer regulation of membrane protein functions are largely controlled by the hydrophobic match between the transmembrane (TM) domain of membrane proteins and the surrounding lipid bilayer. To systematically characterize responses of a TM helix and lipid adaptations to a hydrophobic mismatch, we have performed a total of 5.8-$\mu$s umbrella sampling simulations and calculated the potentials of mean force (PMFs) as a function of TM helix tilt angle under various mismatch conditions. Single-pass TM peptides called WALPn (n = 16,19, 23, and 27) were used In two lipid bilayers with different hydrophobic thicknesses to consider hydrophobic mismatch caused by either the TM length or the bilayer thickness. In addition, different flanking residues, such as alanine, lysine, and arginine, instead of tryptophan in WALP23 were used to examine their influence. The PMFs, their decomposition, and trajectory analysis demonstrate that 1), tilting of a single-pass TM helix is the major response to a hydrophobic mismatch; 2), TM helix tilting up to ∼10° is inherent due to the intrinsic entropic contribution arising from helix precession around the membrane normal even under a negative mismatch; 3), the favorable helix-lipid interaction provides additional driving forces for TM helix tilting under a positive mismatch; 4), the minimum-PMF tilt angle is generally located where there is the hydrophobic match and little lipid perturbation; 5), TM helix rotation is dependent on the specific helix-lipid interaction; and 6), anchoring residues at the hydrophilic/hydrophobic interface can be an important determinant of TM helix orientation. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},[m

Molecular dynamics simulations have become an essential tool to investigate biological problems, and their success relies on proper molecular models together with efficient conformational sampling methods. The implicit representation of solvent/membrane environments is reasonable approximation to the explicit all-atom models, considering the balance between computational cost and simulation accuracy. Implicit models can be easily combined with replica-exchange molecular dynamics methods to explore a wider conformational space of a protein. Other molecular models and enhanced conformational sampling methods are also briefly discussed.

 abstract = {Accurate prediction of intra-molecular interactions from amino acid sequence is an important pre-requisite for obtaining high-quality protein models. Over the recent years, remarkable progress in this area has been achieved through the application of novel co-variation algorithms, which eliminate transitive evolutionary connections between residues. In this work we present a new contact prediction method for $\alpha$-helical transmembrane proteins, MemConP, in which evolutionary couplings are combined with a machine learning approach. MemConP achieves a substantially improved accuracy (precision: 56.0{\%}, recall: 17.5{\%}, MCC: 0.288) compared to the use of either machine learning or co-evolution methods alone. The method also achieves 91.4{\%} precision, 42.1{\%} recall and a MCC of 0.490 in predicting helix-helix interactions based on predicted contacts. The approach was trained and rigorously benchmarked by cross-validation and independent testing on up-to-date non-redundant datasets of 90 and 30 experimental three dimensional structures, respectively. MemConP is a standalone tool that can be downloaded together with the associated training data from http://webclu.bio.wzw.tum.de/MemConP.},[m

For Kant, who was firmly convinced of the existence of inhabitants of other worlds, these heavens were inhabited. He is certain that ‘If it were possible to settle by any sort of experience whether there are inhabitants of at least some of the planets that we see, I might well bet everything that I have on it. Hence I say that it is not merely an opinion but a strong belief (on the correctness of which I would wager many advantages in life) that there are also inhabitants of other worlds.' In this statement by Kant in no less a work than the Critique of Pure Reason one can, on the one hand, recognize a reflection of Kant's earlier convictions and expositions, on the other hand, the context of the citation and the contemporary background are, of course, relevant. Following the example of Kant, this paper investigates the meaning of such reflections about inhabitants of alien worlds, which due to advances in planetary astronomy are today again on the agenda.

Insertion is initiated by the folding of residues 3–11 into an $\alpha$-helix, and mediated by membrane water or by previously inserted peptides. The stability of five alm pore peptides at 413 K with a −0.2 V electric field demonstrates a significant preference for a transmembrane orientation.

 abstract = {Thermodynamic stabilities are pivotal for understanding structure-function relationships of proteins, and yet such determinations are rare for membrane proteins. Moreover, the few measurements that are available have been conducted under very different experimental conditions, which compromises a straightforward extraction of physical principles underlying stability differences. Here, we have overcome this obstacle and provided structure-stability comparisons for multiple membrane proteins. This was enabled by measurements of the free energies of folding and the m values for the transmembrane proteins PhoP/PhoQ-activated gene product (PagP) and outer membrane protein W (OmpW) from Escherichia coli. Our data were collected in the same lipid bilayer and buffer system we previously used to determine those parameters for E. coli outer membrane phospholipase A (OmpLA). Biophysically, our results suggest that the stabilities of these proteins are strongly correlated to the water-to-bilayer transfer free energy of the lipid-facing residues in their transmembrane regions. We further discovered that the sensitivities of these membrane proteins to chemical denaturation, as judged by their m values, was consistent with that previously observed for water-soluble proteins having comparable differences in solvent exposure between their folded and unfolded states. From a biological perspective, our findings suggest that the folding free energies for these membrane proteins may be the thermodynamic sink that establishes an energy gradient across the periplasm, thus driving their sorting by chaperones to the outer membranes in living bacteria. Binding free energies of these outer membrane proteins with periplasmic chaperones support this energy sink hypothesis.},[m

 abstract = {Which properties of the membrane environment are essential for the folding and oligomerization of transmembrane proteins? Because the lipids that surround membrane proteins in situ spontaneously organize into bilayers, it may seem intuitive that interactions with the bilayer provide both hydrophobic and topological constraints that help the protein to achieve a stable and functional three-dimensional structure. However, one may wonder whether folding is actually driven by the membrane environment or whether the folded state just reflects an adaptation of integral proteins to the medium in which they function. Also, apart from the overall transmembrane orientation, might the asymmetry inherent in biosynthesis processes cause proteins to fold to out-of-equilibrium, metastable topologies? Which of the features of a bilayer are essential for membrane protein folding, and which are not? To which extent do translocons dictate transmembrane topologies? Recent data show that many membrane proteins fold and oligomerize very efficiently in media that bear little similarity to a membrane, casting doubt on the essentiality of many bilayer constraints. In the following discussion, we argue that some of the features of bilayers may contribute to protein folding, stability and regulation, but they are not required for the basic three-dimensional structure to be achieved. This idea, if correct, would imply that evolution has steered membrane proteins toward an accommodation to biosynthetic pathways and a good fit into their environment, but that their folding is not driven by the latter or dictated by insertion apparatuses. In other words, the three-dimensional structure of membrane proteins is essentially determined by intramolecular interactions and not by bilayer constraints and insertion pathways. Implications are discussed.},[m

 abstract = {Membrane proteins regulate a large number of cellular functions, and have great potential as tools for manipulation of biological systems. Developing these tools requires a robust and quantitative understanding of membrane protein folding and interactions within the bilayer. With this in mind, we have designed a series of proteins to probe the net thermodynamic contribution of well-known sequence motifs to transmembrane helix-helix association in a biological membrane. The proteins were designed from first principles (de novo) using current knowledge about membrane insertion and stabilizing interaction motifs. A simple poly-Leu "scaffold" was decorated with individual helix interaction motifs (G-XXX-G, polar residues, heptad repeat) to create transmembrane helix-helix interactions of increasing strength. The GALLEX assay, an in vivo assay for measurement of transmembrane helix self-association, was combined with computational methods to characterize the relative strength and mode of interaction for each sequence. In addition, the apparent free energy contribution ($\Delta$$\Delta$G{\textless}sup{\textgreater}app{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) of each motif to transmembrane helix self-association was measured in a biological membrane, results that are the first of their kind for these de novo designed sequences, and suggest that the free energy barrier to overcoming weak association is quite small ({\textless} 1.4 kcal mol{\textless}sup{\textgreater}- 1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) in a natural membrane. By quantifying and rationalizing the contribution of key motifs to transmembrane helix association, our work offers a route to direct the design of novel sequences for use in biotechnology or synthetic biology (e.g. molecular switches) and to predict the effects of sequence modification in known transmembrane domains (for control of cellular processes).},[m

 abstract = {Many cellular events depend on a tightly compartmentalized distribution of H+ ions across membrane-bound organelles. However, measurements of organelle pH in living cells have been scarce. Several mutants of the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) displayed a pH-dependent absorbance and fluorescent emission, with apparent pKa values ranging from 6.15 (mutations F64L/S65T/H231L) and 6.4 (K26R/F64L/S65T/Y66W/N146I/M153T/V163A/N164H/H231L) to a remarkable 7.1 (S65G/S72A/T203Y/H231L). We have targeted these GFPs to the cytosol plus nucleus, the medial/trans-Golgi by fusion with galactosyltransferase, and the mitochondrial matrix by using the targeting signal from subunit IV of cytochrome c oxidase. Cells in culture transfected with these cDNAs displayed the expected subcellular localization by light and electron microscopy and reported local pH that was calibrated in situ with ionophores. We monitored cytosolic and nuclear pH of HeLa cells, and mitochondrial matrix pH in HeLa cells and in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. The pH of the medial/trans-Golgi was measured at steady-state (calibrated to be 6.58 in HeLa cells) and after various manipulations. These demonstrated that the Golgi membrane in intact cells is relatively permeable to H+, and that Cl− serves as a counter-ion for H+ transport and likely helps to maintain electroneutrality. The amenability to engineer GFPs to specific subcellular locations or tissue targets using gene fusion and transfer techniques should allow us to examine pH at sites previously inaccessible. },[m

However, the mechanism of interactions between TM segments of NS2 and surrounding lipid environment remains unclear. Molecular dynamics simulations were applied to investigate the conformation and orientation of the first transmembrane segment (TM1) as well as the interactions of TM1 with a zwitterionic POPC lipid bilayer which identifies several key residues that stabilize the position of TM1 within the membrane. Along with the charged residues R3 and K27, the S23 and H25 were found to be the key elements in establishing the conformation of TM1 inside the membrane. The peptide forms a stable $\alpha$-helix (the sequence 12–21) connected to N-terminal haft in POPC bilayer. The results also reveal that TM1 induces the ordering of lipid and does not destabilize the lipid bilayer system. The hydrophobic mismatch in which the segment tilts an angle along the membrane normal was observed in this system. The binding free energy profile of TM1 to the membrane was also estimated using umbrella sampling.},[m

In this study we find that kinks are a feature of long $\alpha$-helices in both soluble and membrane proteins, rather than just transmembrane $\alpha$-helices. The apparent rarity of kinks in soluble proteins is due to the relative infrequency of long helices (≥20 residues) in these proteins. We compare length-matched sets of soluble and membrane helices, and find that the frequency of kinks, the role of Proline, the patterns of other amino acid around kinks (allowing for the expected differences in amino acid distributions between the two types of protein), and the effects of hydrogen bonds are the same for the two types of helices. In both types of protein, helices that contain Proline in the second and subsequent turns are very frequently kinked. However, there are a sizeable proportion of kinked helices that do not contain a Proline in either their sequence or sequence homolog. Moreover, we observe that in soluble proteins, kinked helices have a structural preference in that they typically point into the solvent.

 abstract = {MOTIVATION: Knowledge of the transmembrane helical topology can help identify binding sites and infer functions for membrane proteins. However, because membrane proteins are hard to solubilize and purify, only a very small amount of membrane proteins have structure and topology experimentally determined. This has motivated various computational methods for predicting the topology of membrane proteins. RESULTS: We present an improved hidden Markov model, TMMOD, for the identification and topology prediction of transmembrane proteins. Our model uses TMHMM as a prototype, but differs from TMHMM by the architecture of the submodels for loops on both sides of the membrane and also by the model training procedure. In cross-validation experiments using a set of 83 transmembrane proteins with known topology, TMMOD outperformed TMHMM and other existing methods, with an accuracy of 89{\%} for both topology and locations. In another experiment using a separate set of 160 transmembrane proteins, TMMOD had 84{\%} for topology and 89{\%} for locations. When utilized for identifying transmembrane proteins from non-transmembrane proteins, particularly signal peptides, TMMOD has consistently fewer false positives than TMHMM does. Application of TMMOD to a collection of complete genomes shows that the number of predicted membrane proteins accounts for approximately 20-30{\%} of all genes in those genomes, and that the topology where both the N- and C-termini are in the cytoplasm is dominant in these organisms except for Caenorhabditis elegans.

Unfortunately, as these proteins are not water soluble, it is extremely hard to experimentally determine their structure. Therefore, improved methods for predicting the structure of these proteins are vital in biological research. In order to improve transmembrane topology prediction, we evaluate the combined use of both integrated signal peptide prediction and evolutionary information in a single algorithm. RESULTS: A new method (MEMSAT3) for predicting transmembrane protein topology from sequence profiles is described and benchmarked with full cross-validation on a standard data set of 184 transmembrane proteins. The method is found to predict both the correct topology and the locations of transmembrane segments for 80{\%} of the test set. This compares with accuracies of 62-72{\%} for other popular methods on the same benchmark.

 abstract = {MEASUREMENTS of the surface area accessible to solvent provide a convenient definition of the surface and the inside volumes in proteins of known X-ray structure. The study of the accessibility to solvent of amino acid residues in several proteins1–3 has confirmed the early observation that polar residues are found mostly on the surface and non-polar residues mostly inside globular protein structures. But the accessibility shows systematic variations with the molecular weight, because of the change in surface to volume ratio. Experimental data4 indicate that the accessible surface area A (in {\AA}2) of monomeric globular proteins follows the law5,6: which implies that the mean accessible surface area per residues decreases like M −1/3 (where M is molecular weight) with increasing M, from about 68 {\AA}2 for proteins of 6,000 molecular weight to 38 {\AA}2 for proteins of 35,000 molecular weight. Thus, the accessibility to solvent is not a characteristic of the amino acids.},[m

 abstract = {TA (tail-anchored) proteins utilize distinct biosynthetic pathways, including TRC40 (transmembrane domain recognition complex of 40 kDa)-mediated, chaperone-dependent and/or unassisted routes to the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) membrane. We have addressed the flexibility of cytosolic components participating in these pathways, and explored the thermodynamic constraints of their membrane insertion, by exploiting recombinant forms of Sec61$\beta$ and Cytb5 (cytochrome b5) bearing covalent modifications within their TA region. In both cases, efficient membrane insertion relied on cytosolic factors capable of accommodating a surprising range of covalent modifications to the TA region. For Sec61$\beta$, we found that both SGTA (small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein $\alpha$) and TRC40 can bind this substrate with a singly PEGylated TA region. However, by introducing two PEG [poly(ethylene glycol)] moieties, TRC40 binding can be prevented, resulting in a block of subsequent membrane integration. Although TRC40 can bind Sec61$\beta$ polypeptides singly PEGylated at different locations, membrane insertion is more sensitive to the precise location of PEG attachment. Modelling and experimentation indicate that this post-TRC40 effect results from an increased energetic cost of inserting different PEGylated TA regions into the lipid bilayer. We therefore propose that the membrane integration of TA proteins delivered via TRC40 is strongly dependent upon underlying thermodynamics, and speculate that their insertion is via a phospholipid-mediated process.},[m

The recently elucidated GET (Guided Entry of TA proteins) pathway is responsible for the targeted delivery of tail-anchored (TA) membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum. The central player is the ATPase Get3, which in its free form exists as a dimer. Biochemical evidence suggests a role for a tetramer of Get3. Here, we present the first crystal structure of an archaeal Get3 homologue that exists as a tetramer and is capable of TA protein binding. The tetramer generates a hydrophobic chamber that we propose binds the TA protein. We use small-angle X-ray scattering to provide the first structural information of a fungal Get3/TA protein complex showing that the overall molecular envelope is consistent with the archaeal tetramer structure. Moreover, we show that this fungal tetramer complex is capable of TA insertion. This allows us to suggest a model where a tetramer of Get3 sequesters a TA protein during targeting to the membrane.},[m

 abstract = {Membrane insertion by the Sec61 translocon in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is highly dependent on hydrophobicity. This places stringent hydrophobicity requirements on transmembrane domains (TMDs) from single-spanning membrane proteins. On examining the single-spanning influenza A membrane proteins, we found that the strict hydrophobicity requirement applies to the N(out)-C(in) HA and M2 TMDs but not the N(in)-C(out) TMDs from the type II membrane protein neuraminidase (NA). To investigate this discrepancy, we analyzed NA TMDs of varying hydrophobicity, followed by increasing polypeptide lengths, in mammalian cells and ER microsomes. Our results show that the marginally hydrophobic NA TMDs ($\Delta$G(app) {\textgreater} 0 kcal/mol) require the cotranslational insertion process for facilitating their inversion during translocation and a positively charged N-terminal flanking residue and that NA inversion enhances its plasma membrane localization. Overall the cotranslational inversion of marginally hydrophobic NA TMDs initiates once {\~{}}70 amino acids past the TMD are synthesized, and the efficiency reaches 50{\%} by {\~{}}100 amino acids, consistent with the positioning of this TMD class in type II human membrane proteins. Inversion of the M2 TMD, achieved by elongating its C-terminus, underscores the contribution of cotranslational synthesis to TMD inversion.},[m

However, the fundamental mechanism responsible for the near-unity quantum efficiency of this process is unknown. Here we elucidate the role of coherence in determining the efficiency of charge separation in the plant photosystem II reaction centre by comprehensively combining experiment (two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy) and theory (Redfield theory). We reveal the presence of electronic coherence between excitons as well as between exciton and charge-transfer states that we argue to be maintained by vibrational modes. Furthermore, we present evidence for the strong correlation between the degree of electronic coherence and efficient and ultrafast charge separation. We propose that this coherent mechanism will inspire the development of new energy technologies.},[m

 abstract = {The minimum hydrophobic length necessary to form a transmembrane (TM) helix in membranes was investigated using model membrane-inserted hydrophobic helices. The fluorescence of a Trp at the center of the sequence and its sensitivity to quenching were used to ascertain helix position within the membrane. Peptides with hydrophobic cores composed of poly(Leu) were compared to sequences containing a poly 1:1 Leu:Ala core (which have a hydrophobicity typical of natural TM helices). Studies varying bilayer width revealed that the poly(Leu) core peptides predominately formed a TM state when the bilayer width exceeded hydrophobic sequence length by (i.e. when negative mismatch was) up to ∼ 11-12 {\AA} (e.g. the case of a 11-12 residue hydrophobic sequence in bilayers with a biologically relevant width, i.e. dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayers), while poly(LeuAla) core peptides formed predominantly TM state with negative mismatch of up to 9 {\AA} (a 13 residue hydrophobic sequence in DOPC bilayers). This indicates that minimum length necessary to form a predominating amount of a TM state (minimum TM length) is only modestly hydrophobicity-dependent for the sequences studied here, and a formula that defines the minimum TM length as a function of hydrophobicity for moderately-to-highly hydrophobic sequences was derived. The minimum length able to form a stable TM helix for alternating LeuAla sequences, and that for sequences with a Leu block followed by an Ala block, was similar, suggesting that a hydrophobicity gradient along the sequence may not be an important factor in TM stability. TM stability was also similar for sequences flanked by different charged ionizable residues (Lys, His, Asp). However, ionizable flanking residues destabilized the TM configuration much more when charged than when uncharged. The ability of short hydrophobic sequences to form TM helices in membranes in the presence of substantial negative mismatch implies that lipid bilayers have a considerable ability to adjust to negative mismatch, and that short TM helices may be more common than generally believed. Factors that modulate the ability of bilayers to adjust to mismatch may strongly affect the configuration of short hydrophobic helices. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},[m

However, solubilization in detergents or reconstitution in liposomes or supported monolayers sometimes suffers from loss of activity and problematic analyses due to heterogeneity and aggregation. A developing technology termed nanodiscs exploits discoidal phospholipid bilayers encircled by a stabilizing amphipatic helical membrane scaffold protein to reconstitute membranes with integral proteins. After reconstitution, the membrane nanodisc is soluble, stable, and monodisperse. In the present review, we outline the biological inspiration for nanodiscs as discoidal high-density lipoproteins, the assembly and handling of nanodiscs, and finally their diverse biochemical applications. In our view, major advantages of nanodisc technology for integral membrane proteins is homogeneity, control of oligomerization state, access to both sides of the membrane, and control of lipids in the local membrane environment of the integral protein.},[m

Current data on structurally related modulators suggest that cholesterol binds to subunit interfaces between transmembrane domains of the GABAAR. We construct homology models of a human GABAAR based on the structure of the glutamate-gated chloride channel GluCl of Caenorhabditis elegans. The models show the possibility of previously unreported disulfide bridges linking the M1 and M3 transmembrane helices in the $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ subunits. We discuss the biological relevance of such disulfide bridges. Using our models, we investigate cholesterol binding to intersubunit cavities of the GABAAR transmembrane domain. We find that very similar binding modes are predicted independently by three approaches: analogy with ivermectin in the GluCl crystal structure, automated docking by AutoDock, and spontaneous rebinding events in unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. Taken together, the models and atomistic simulations suggest a somewhat flexible binding mode, with several possible orientations. Finally, we explore the possibility that cholesterol promotes pore opening through a wedge mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},[m

 abstract = {The free energy of transfer of nonpolar solutes from water to lipid bilayers is often dominated by a large negative enthalpy rather than the large positive entropy expected from the hydrophobic effect. This common observation has led to the idea that membrane partitioning is driven by the "nonclassical" hydrophobic effect. We examined this phenomenon by characterizing the partitioning of the well-studied peptide melittin using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and circular dichroism (CD). We studied the temperature dependence of the entropic (-T$\Delta$S) and enthalpic ($\Delta$H) components of free energy ($\Delta$G) of partitioning of melittin into lipid membranes made of various mixtures of zwitterionic and anionic lipids. We found significant variations of the entropic and enthalpic components with temperature, lipid composition and vesicle size but only small changes in $\Delta$G (entropy-enthalpy compensation). The heat capacity associated with partitioning had a large negative value of about -0.5 kcal mol(-1) K(-1). This hallmark of the hydrophobic effect was found to be independent of lipid composition. The measured heat capacity values were used to calculate the hydrophobic-effect free energy $\Delta$G (h$\Phi$), which we found to dominate melittin partitioning regardless of lipid composition. In the case of anionic membranes, additional free energy comes from coulombic attraction, which is characterized by a small effective peptide charge due to the lack of additivity of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions in membrane interfaces [Ladokhin and White J Mol Biol 309:543-552, 2001]. Our results suggest that there is no need for a special effect-the nonclassical hydrophobic effect-to describe partitioning into lipid bilayers.},[m

 abstract = {Intramembrane proteolysis is a new paradigm in biology that controls signaling events throughout evolution. Hydrolysis of peptide bonds is thought to occur within the normally hydrophobic membrane environment, but insights into this unusual activity have been lacking because of difficulty in recapitulating activity in vitro. We have reconstituted intramembrane proteolysis with a pure recombinant substrate and rhomboid proteins in both detergent micelles and artificial membrane environments. Rhomboid proteins from diverse organisms including two model bacteria, a pathogen, an extremophile, and an animal were robustly active in pure form, proving that rhomboids are a new class of enzymes and do not require cofactors to catalyze intramembrane proteolysis. Rhomboid proteins directly recognized their substrates in vitro by the top of the substrate transmembrane domain, displaying specificity apparently reciprocal to that of gamma-secretase, the only other activity known to cleave type-I transmembrane domains. Rhomboid proteases represent a different evolutionary path to a serine protease mechanism and exhibited an inhibitor profile unlike other serine proteases. Intriguingly, activity was dramatically modulated by different membrane phospholipid environments, suggesting a mechanism for regulating these proteases. This analysis promises to help reveal the biochemical mechanisms and biological roles of this most widely conserved membrane protein family.},[m

 abstract = {The light-induced isomerization of the retinal from 11-c/s to all-frans triggers changes in the conformation of visual rhodopsins that lead to the formation of the activated state, which is ready to interact with the G protein. To begin to understand how changes in the structure and dynamics of the retinal are transmitted to the protein, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of squid rhodopsin with 11-c/s and all-frans retinal, and with two different force fields for describing the retinal molecule. The results indicate that structural rearrangements in the binding pocket, albeit small, propagate toward the cytoplasmic side of the protein, and affect the dynamics of internal water molecules. The sensitivity of the active-site interactions on the retinal force-field parameters highlights the coupling between the retinal molecule and its immediate protein environment. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},[m

Upon the addition of salt, the peptide spontaneously assembles to form a macroscopic membrane. The membrane does not dissolve in heat or in acidic or alkaline solutions, nor does it dissolve upon addition of guanidine hydrochloride, SDS/urea, or a variety of proteolytic enzymes. Scanning EM reveals a network of interwoven filaments approximately 10-20 nm in diameter. An important component of the stability is probably due to formation of complementary ionic bonds between glutamic and lysine side chains.

Work that straddled disciplines was often published in journals catering to a broad readership.

 abstract = {Dimerization-driven activation of the intracellular kinase domains of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) upon extracellular ligand binding is crucial to cellular pathways regulating proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Inactive EGFR can exist as both monomers and dimers, suggesting that the mechanism regulating EGFR activity may be subtle. The membrane itself may play a role but creates substantial difficulties for structural studies. Our molecular dynamics simulations of membrane-embedded EGFR suggest that, in ligand-bound dimers, the extracellular domains assume conformations favoring dimerization of the transmembrane helices near their N termini, dimerization of the juxtamembrane segments, and formation of asymmetric (active) kinase dimers. In ligand-free dimers, by holding apart the N termini of the transmembrane helices, the extracellular domains instead favor C-terminal dimerization of the transmembrane helices, juxtamembrane segment dissociation and membrane burial, and formation of symmetric (inactive) kinase dimers. Electrostatic interactions of EGFR's intracellular module with the membrane are critical in maintaining this coupling. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},[m

 abstract = {Export signal sequences target newly synthesized proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic cells and the plasma membrane of bacteria. All signal sequences contain a hydrophobic core region, but, despite this, they show great variation in both overall length and amino acid sequence. Recently, it has become clear that this variation allows signal sequences to specify different modes of targeting and membrane insertion and even to perform functions after being cleaved from the parent protein. This review argues that signal sequences are not simply greasy peptides but sophisticated, multipurpose peptides containing a wealth of functional information.},[m

 abstract = {Carbonated beverages are commonly available and immensely popular, but little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the perception of carbonation in the mouth. In mammals, carbonation elicits both somatosensory and chemosensory responses, including activation of taste neurons. We have identified the cellular and molecular substrates for the taste of carbonation. By targeted genetic ablation and the silencing of synapses in defined populations of taste receptor cells, we demonstrated that the sour-sensing cells act as the taste sensors for carbonation, and showed that carbonic anhydrase 4, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored enzyme, functions as the principal CO2 taste sensor. Together, these studies reveal the basis of the taste of carbonation as well as the contribution of taste cells in the orosensory response to CO2.},[m

To establish the structural requirements for the function of signal and signal-anchor sequences, we constructed chimeric proteins containing artificial topogenic sequences in which the N-terminal net charge and the length of the hydrophobic segment were systematically altered. Utilizing an in vitro translation-translocation system, we found that hydrophobic segments consisting of 7-10 leucine residues functioned as signal sequences whereas segments with 12-15 leucine residues showed different topogenic functions, behaving as signal sequences or P-450-type signal-anchor sequences, depending on the N-terminal charge. From these observations, we propose that the function of N-terminal topogenic sequences depends on a balance between the N-terminal charge and the length of the following hydrophobic segment.},[m

 abstract = {With synthetic gene services, molecular cloning is as easy as ordering a pizza. However choosing the right RNA code for efficient protein production is less straightforward, more akin to deciding on the pizza toppings. The possibility to choose synonymous codons in the gene sequence has ignited a discussion that dates back 50 years: Does synonymous codon use matter? Recent studies indicate that replacement of particular codons for synonymous codons can improve expression in homologous or heterologous hosts, however it is not always successful. Furthermore it is increasingly apparent that membrane protein biogenesis can be codon-sensitive. Single synonymous codon substitutions can influence mRNA stability, mRNA structure, translational initiation, translational elongation and even protein folding. Synonymous codon substitutions therefore need to be carefully evaluated when membrane proteins are engineered for higher production levels and further studies are needed to fully understand how to select the codons that are optimal for higher production. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The virus, provisionally named parvovirus-like hybrid virus (PHV), is nearly identi- cal by sequence to anotherDNAvirus, NIH-CQV, previously detected in Chinese patients with seronegative (non-A-E) hepatitis. Although we initially detectedPHVin a wide range of clinical samples, with all strains sharing?99{\%} nucleotide and amino acid identity with each other and with NIH-CQV, the exact origin of the virus was eventually traced to contaminated silica-binding spin columns used for nucleic acid extraction. Definitive confirmation of the origin of PHV, and presumably NIH-CQV, was obtained by in-depth analyses of water eluted through contaminated spin columns. Analysis of environmental metagenome li- braries detectedPHVsequences in coastal marine waters of North America, suggesting that a potential association betweenPHV and diatoms (algae) that generate the silica matrix used in the spin columns may have resulted in inadvertent viral contamina- tion during manufacture. The confirmation of PHV/NIH-CQV as laboratory reagent contaminants and not bona fide infectious agents of humans underscores the rigorous approach needed to establish the validity of new viral genomes discovered by next- generation sequencing.

 abstract = {Seronegative hepatitis--non-A, non-B, non-C, non-D, non-E hepatitis--is poorly characterized but strongly associated with serious complications. We collected 92 sera specimens from patients with non-A-E hepatitis in Chongqing, China between 1999 and 2007. Ten sera pools were screened by Solexa deep sequencing. We discovered a 3,780-bp contig present in all 10 pools that yielded BLASTx E scores of 7e-05-0.008 against parvoviruses. The complete sequence of the in silico-assembled 3,780-bp contig was confirmed by gene amplification of overlapping regions over almost the entire genome, and the virus was provisionally designated NIH-CQV. Further analysis revealed that the contig was composed of two major ORFs. By protein BLAST, ORF1 and ORF2 were most homologous to the replication-associated protein of bat circovirus and the capsid protein of porcine parvovirus, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that NIH-CQV is located at the interface of Parvoviridae and Circoviridae. Prevalence of NIH-CQV in patients was determined by quantitative PCR. Sixty-three of 90 patient samples (70{\%}) were positive, but all those from 45 healthy controls were negative. Average virus titer in the patient specimens was 1.05 e4 copies/µL. Specific antibodies against NIH-CQV were sought by immunoblotting. Eighty-four percent of patients were positive for IgG, and 31{\%} were positive for IgM; in contrast, 78{\%} of healthy controls were positive for IgG, but all were negative for IgM. Although more work is needed to determine the etiologic role of NIH-CQV in human disease, our data indicate that a parvovirus-like virus is highly prevalent in a cohort of patients with non-A-E hepatitis.},[m

 abstract = {Motivated by ongoing efforts to understand the mechanism of membrane protein crystallogenesis and transport in the lipidic cubic phase, the nature of the interaction between tryptophan and the bilayer/aqueous interface of the cubic phase has been investigated. The association was quantified by partitioning measurements that enabled the free energy of interaction to be determined. Temperature-dependent partitioning was used to parse the association free energy change into its enthalpic and entropic components. As has been observed with tryptophan derivatives interacting with glycerophospholipid bilayers in vesicles, tryptophan partitioning in the cubic phase is enthalpy driven. This is in contrast to partitioning into apolar solvents, which exhibits the classic hydrophobic effect whose hallmark is a favorable entropy change. These results with tryptophan are somewhat surprising given the simplicity, homogeneity, and curvature of the interface that prevails in the case of the cubic phase. Nevertheless, the interaction between tryptophan and the mesophase is very slight as revealed by its low partition coefficient. Additional evidence in support of the interaction was obtained by electronic absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and fluorescence quenching. Partitioning proved insensitive to the lipid composition of the membrane, examined by doping with glycerophospholipids. However, the interaction could be manipulated in meaningful ways by the inclusion in the aqueous medium of salt, glycerol, or urea. The effects seen with tryptophan were amplified rationally when measurements were repeated using tryptophan alkyl esters and with tryptophan peptides of increasing length. These findings are interpreted in the context of the insertion, folding, and function of proteins in membranes.},[m

Previous studies on the integration of model transmembrane segments into the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER) have provided a rather detailed quantitative picture of the relation between amino acid sequence and membrane-integration propensity for proteins targeted to the Sec61 translocon. We have now carried out a comparative study of the integration of Nout-Cin-orientated 19-residue-long polypeptide segments into the ER of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that the 'threshold hydrophobicity' required for insertion into the ER membrane is very similar in S. cerevisiae and in mammalian cells. Further, when comparing the contributions to the apparent free energy of membrane insertion of the 20 natural amino acids between the S. cerevisiae and the mammalian ER, we find that the two scales are strongly correlated but that the absolute difference between the most hydrophobic and most hydrophilic residues is ∼ 2-fold smaller in S. cerevisiae. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether language used in science abstracts can skew towards the use of strikingly positive and negative words over time.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: Retrospective analysis of all scientific abstracts in PubMed between 1974 and 2014.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The yearly frequencies of positive, negative, and neutral words (25 preselected words in each category), plus 100 randomly selected words were normalised for the total number of abstracts. Subanalyses included pattern quantification of individual words, specificity for selected high impact journals, and comparison between author affiliations within or outside countries with English as the official majority language. Frequency patterns were compared with 4{\%} of all books ever printed and digitised by use of Google Books Ngram Viewer.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequencies of positive and negative words in abstracts compared with frequencies of words with a neutral and random connotation, expressed as relative change since 1980.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The absolute frequency of positive words increased from 2.0{\%} (1974-80) to 17.5{\%} (2014), a relative increase of 880{\%} over four decades. All 25 individual positive words contributed to the increase, particularly the words "robust," "novel," "innovative," and "unprecedented," which increased in relative frequency up to 15 000{\%}. Comparable but less pronounced results were obtained when restricting the analysis to selected journals with high impact factors. Authors affiliated to an institute in a non-English speaking country used significantly more positive words. Negative word frequencies increased from 1.3{\%} (1974-80) to 3.2{\%} (2014), a relative increase of 257{\%}. Over the same time period, no apparent increase was found in neutral or random word use, or in the frequency of positive word use in published books.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our lexicographic analysis indicates that scientific abstracts are currently written with more positive and negative words, and provides an insight into the evolution of scientific writing. Apparently scientists look on the bright side of research results. But whether this perception fits reality should be questioned.},[m

 abstract = {Hydrophobicity analyses applied to databases of soluble and transmembrane (TM) proteins of known structure were used to resolve total genomic hydrophobicity profiles into (helical) TM sequences and mainly "subhydrophobic" soluble components. This information was used to define a refined "hydrophobicity"-type TM sequence prediction scale that should approach the theoretical limit of accuracy. The refinement procedure involved adjusting scale values to eliminate differences between the average amino acid composition of populations TM and soluble sequences of equal hydrophobicity, a required property of a scale having maximum accuracy. Application of this procedure to different hydrophobicity scales caused them to collapse to essentially a single TM tendency scale. As expected, when different scales were compared, the TM tendency scale was the most accurate at predicting TM sequences. It was especially highly correlated (r = 0.95) to the biological hydrophobicity scale, derived experimentally from the percent TM conformation formed by artificial sequences passing though the translocon. It was also found that resolution of total genomic sequence data into TM and soluble components could be used to define the percent probability that a sequence with a specific hydrophobicity value forms a TM segment. Application of the TM tendency scale to whole genomic data revealed an overlap of TM and soluble sequences in the "semihydrophobic" range. This raises the possibility that a significant number of proteins have sequences that can switch between TM and non-TM states. Such proteins may exist in moonlighting forms having properties very different from those of the predominant conformation.},[m

 abstract = {Many proteins are translocated through the SecY channel in bacteria and archaea and through the related Sec61 channel in eukaryotes. The channel has an hourglass shape with a narrow constriction approximately halfway across the membrane, formed by a pore ring of amino acids. While the cytoplasmic cavity of the channel is empty, the extracellular cavity is filled with a short helix called the plug, which moves out of the way during protein translocation. The mechanism by which the channel transports large polypeptides and yet prevents the passage of small molecules, such as ions or metabolites, has been controversial. Here, we have addressed this issue in intact Escherichia coli cells by testing the permeation of small molecules through wild-type and mutant SecY channels, which are either in the resting state or contain a defined translocating polypeptide chain. We show that in the resting state, the channel is sealed by both the pore ring and the plug domain. During translocation, the pore ring forms a 'gasket-like' seal around the polypeptide chain, preventing the permeation of small molecules. The structural conservation of the channel in all organisms indicates that this may be a universal mechanism by which the membrane barrier is maintained during protein translocation.},[m

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To quantify the consumption of chocolates in a hospital ward environment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: Multicentre, prospective, covert observational study.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSETTING: Four wards at three hospitals (where the authors worked) within the United Kingdom.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPARTICIPANTS: Boxes of Quality Street (Nestl{\'{e}}) and Roses (Cadbury) on the ward and anyone eating these chocolates.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERVENTION: Observers covertly placed two 350 g boxes of Quality Street and Roses chocolates on each ward (eight boxes were used in the study containing a total of 258 individual chocolates). These boxes were kept under continuous covert surveillance, with the time recorded when each chocolate was eaten.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Median survival time of a chocolate.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: 191 out of 258 (74{\%}) chocolates were observed being eaten. The mean total observation period was 254 minutes (95{\%} confidence interval 179 to 329). The median survival time of a chocolate was 51 minutes (39 to 63). The model of chocolate consumption was non-linear, with an initial rapid rate of consumption that slowed with time. An exponential decay model best fitted these findings (model R(2)=0.844, P{\textless}0.001), with a survival half life (time taken for 50{\%} of the chocolates to be eaten) of 99 minutes. The mean time taken to open a box of chocolates from first appearance on the ward was 12 minutes (95{\%} confidence interval 0 to 24). Quality Street chocolates survived longer than Roses chocolates (hazard ratio for survival of Roses v Quality Street 0.70, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.53 to 0.93, P=0.014). The highest percentages of chocolates were consumed by healthcare assistants (28{\%}) and nurses (28{\%}), followed by doctors (15{\%}).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: From our observational study, chocolate survival in a hospital ward was relatively short, and was modelled well by an exponential decay model. Roses chocolates were preferentially consumed to Quality Street chocolates in a ward setting. Chocolates were consumed primarily by healthcare assistants and nurses, followed by doctors. Further practical studies are needed.},[m

 abstract = {A novel folding motif has been observed in four different proteins which bind oligonucleotides or oligosaccharides: staphylococcal nuclease, anticodon binding domain of asp-tRNA synthetase and B-subunits of heat-labile enterotoxin and verotoxin-1. The common fold of the four proteins, which we call the OB-fold, has a five-stranded beta-sheet coiled to form a closed beta-barrel. This barrel is capped by an alpha-helix located between the third and fourth strands. The barrel-helix frameworks can be superimposed with r.m.s. deviations of 1.4-2.2 A, but no similarities can be observed in the corresponding alignment of the four sequences. The nucleotide or sugar binding sites, known for three of the four proteins, are located in nearly the same position in each protein: on the side surface of the beta-barrel, where three loops come together. Here we describe the determinants of the OB-fold, based on an analysis of all four structures. These proposed determinants explain how very different sequences adopt the OB-fold. They also suggest a reinterpretation of the controversial structure of gene 5 ssDNA binding protein, which exhibits some topological and functional similarities with the OB-fold proteins.},[m

 abstract = {Replication protein A (RPA) is the ubiquitous, eukaryotic single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein and is essential for DNA replication, recombination, and repair. Here, crystal structures of the soluble RPA heterodimer, composed of the RPA14 and RPA32 subunits, have been determined for the full-length protein in multiple crystal forms. In all crystals, the electron density for the N-terminal (residues 1-42) and C-terminal (residues 175-270) regions of RPA32 is weak and of poor quality indicating that these regions are disordered and/or assume multiple positions in the crystals. Hence, the RPA32 N terminus, that is hyperphosphorylated in a cell-cycle-dependent manner and in response to DNA damaging agents, appears to be inherently disordered in the unphosphorylated state. The C-terminal, winged helix-loop-helix, protein-protein interaction domain adopts several conformations perhaps to facilitate its interaction with various proteins. Although the ordered regions of RPA14/32 resemble the previously solved protease-resistant core crystal structure, the quaternary structures between the heterodimers are quite different. Thus, the four-helix bundle quaternary assembly noted in the original core structure is unlikely to be related to the quaternary structure of the intact heterotrimer. An organic ligand binding site between subunits RPA14 and RPA32 was identified to bind dioxane. Comparison of the ssDNA binding surfaces of RPA70 with RPA14/32 showed that the lower affinity of RPA14/32 can be attributed to a shallower binding crevice with reduced positive electrostatic charge. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {Many bacteria are naturally competent, able to actively transport environmental DNA fragments across their cell envelope and into their cytoplasm. Because incoming DNA fragments can recombine with and replace homologous segments of the chromosome, competence provides cells with a potent mechanism of horizontal gene transfer as well as access to the nutrients in extracellular DNA. This review starts with an introductory overview of competence and continues with a detailed consideration of the DNA uptake specificity of competent proteobacteria in the Pasteurellaceae and Neisseriaceae. Species in these distantly related families exhibit strong preferences for genomic DNA from close relatives, a self-specificity arising from the combined effects of biases in the uptake machinery and genomic overrepresentation of the sequences this machinery prefers. Other competent species tested lack obvious uptake bias or uptake sequences, suggesting that strong convergent evolutionary forces have acted on these two families. Recent results show that uptake sequences have multiple "dialects," with clades within each family preferring distinct sequence variants and having corresponding variants enriched in their genomes. Although the genomic consensus uptake sequences are 12 and 29 to 34 bp, uptake assays have found that only central cores of 3 to 4 bp, conserved across dialects, are crucial for uptake. The other bases, which differ between dialects, make weaker individual contributions but have important cooperative interactions. Together, these results make predictions about the mechanism of DNA uptake across the outer membrane, supporting a model for the evolutionary accumulation and stability of uptake sequences and suggesting that uptake biases may be more widespread than currently thought.},[m

This phenomenon, known as horizontal, or lateral, gene transfer, has been a major force for genome plasticity over evolutionary history, and is largely responsible for the spread of fitness-enhancing traits, including antibiotic resistance and virulence factors. In particular, for adaptation of prokaryotes to extreme environments, lateral gene transfer seems to have played a crucial role. Here, we present a survey of the natural transformation machinery of the thermophile Thermus thermophilus HB27. A tentative model of the transformation machinery comprising of components similar to proteins of type IV pili and type II secretion systems is presented. A comparative discussion of the subunits and the structure of the DNA translocator and the underlying mechanism of transfer of free DNA in T. thermophilus highlights conserved and unique features of the DNA translocator in T. thermophilus. We hypothesize that the extraordinary broad substrate specificity and the high efficiency of the T. thermophilus DNA uptake system is of major importance for thermoadaptation and interdomain DNA transfer in hot environments.},[m

Transmembrane helices exist in the relatively uniform low dielectric interstices of the lipid bilayer, largely devoid of water and with a very hydrophobic distribution of amino acid residues. Here, through an analysis of bacteriorhodopsin crystal structures and the transmembrane helix structure from M2 protein of influenza A, some helices are shown to be exceptionally uniform in hydrogen bond geometry, peptide plane tilt angle, and backbone torsion angles. Evidence from both the x-ray crystal structures and solid-state NMR structure suggests that the intramolecular backbone hydrogen bonds are shorter than their counterparts in water-soluble proteins. Moreover, the geometry is consistent with a dominance of electrostatic versus covalent contributions to these bonds. A comparison of structure as a function of resolution shows that as the structures become better characterized the helices become much more uniform, suggesting that there is a possibility that many more uniform helices will be observed, even among the moderate resolution membrane protein structures that are currently in the Protein Data Bank that do not show such features.},[m

 abstract = {The recognition of transmembrane helices by the translocon is primarily guided by the average hydrophobicity of the potential transmembrane helix. However, the exact hydrophobicity of each amino acid can be identified in several different ways. The free energy of transfer for amino acid analogues between a hydrophobic media, for example, octanol and water can be measured or obtained from simulations, the hydrophobicity can also be estimated by statistical properties from known transmembrane segments and finally the contribution of each amino acid type for the probability of translocon recognition has recently been measured directly. Although these scales correlate quite well, there are clear differences between them and it is not well understood which scale represents neither the biology best nor what the differences are. Here, we try to provide some answers to this by studying the ability of different scales to recognize transmembrane helices and predict the topology of transmembrane proteins. From this analysis it is clear that the biological hydrophobicity scale as well scales created from statistical analysis of membrane helices perform better than earlier experimental scales that are mainly based on measurements of amino acid analogs and not directly on transmembrane helix recognition. Using these results we identified the properties of the scales that perform better than other scales. We find, for instance, that the better performing scales consider proline more hydrophilic. This shows that transmembrane recognition is not only governed by pure hydrophobicity but also by the helix preferences for amino acids, as proline is a strong helix breaker.},[m

 abstract = {Prostaglandins (PG) are bioactive lipids produced from arachidonic acid via the action of cyclooxygenases and terminal PG synthases. Microsomal prostaglandin E synthase 1 (MPGES1) constitutes an inducible glutathione-dependent integral membrane protein that catalyzes the oxidoreduction of cyclooxygenase derived PGH(2) into PGE(2). MPGES1 has been implicated in a number of human diseases or pathological conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, fever, and pain, and is therefore regarded as a primary target for development of novel antiinflammatory drugs. To provide a structural basis for insight in the catalytic mechanism, we determined the structure of MPGES1 in complex with glutathione by electron crystallography from 2D crystals induced in the presence of phospholipids. Together with results from site-directed mutagenesis and activity measurements, we can thereby demonstrate the role of specific amino acid residues. Glutathione is found to bind in a U-shaped conformation at the interface between subunits in the protein trimer. It is exposed to a site facing the lipid bilayer, which forms the specific environment for the oxidoreduction of PGH(2) to PGE(2) after displacement of the cytoplasmic half of the N-terminal transmembrane helix. Hence, insight into the dynamic behavior of MPGES1 and homologous membrane proteins in inflammation and detoxification is provided.},[m

 abstract = {A distinct class of proteins contain a C-terminal membrane anchor and a cytoplasmic functional domain. A subset of these proteins is targeted to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Here, to probe for the involvement of a saturable targeting mechanism for this class of proteins, and to elucidate the roles of chaperone proteins and ATP, we have utilized an in vitro targeting system consisting of in vitro-synthesized proteins and isolated mitochondria. To establish the specificity of targeting we have used a closely related protein pair. VAMP-1A and VAMP-1B are splice variants of the vesicle-associated membrane protein/synaptobrevin-1 (VAMP-1) gene. In intact cells VAMP-1B is targeted to mitochondria whereas VAMP-1A is targeted to membranes of the secretory pathway, yet these isoforms differ by only five amino acids at the extreme C-terminus. Here we demonstrate that, in vitro, VAMP-1B is imported into both intact mitochondria and mitochondrial outer-membrane vesicles with a 15-fold greater efficiency than VAMP-1A. We generated and purified bacterially expressed fusion proteins consisting of the C-terminal two-thirds of VAMP-1A or -1B proteins fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST). Using these fusion proteins we demonstrate that protein targeting and insertion is saturable and specific for the VAMP-1B membrane anchor. To elucidate the role of cytosolic chaperones on VAMP-1B targeting, we also used the purified, Escherichia coli-derived fusion proteins. (33)P-Labelled GST-VAMP-1B(61-116), but not GST-VAMP-1A(61-118), was efficiently targeted to mitochondria in a chaperone-free system. Thus the information required for targeting is contained within the targeted protein itself and not the chaperone or a chaperone-protein complex, although chaperones may be required to maintain a transport-competent conformation. Moreover, ATP was required for transport only in the presence of cytosolic chaperone proteins. Therefore the ATP requirement of transport appears to reflect the participation of chaperones and not any other ATP-dependent step. These data demonstrate that targeting of C-terminally anchored proteins to mitochondria is sequence specific and mediated by a saturable mechanism. Neither ATP nor chaperone proteins are strictly required for either specific targeting or membrane insertion.},[m

 abstract = {By analyzing transmembrane (TM) helices in known structures, we find that some polar amino acids are more frequent at the N terminus than at the C terminus. We propose the asymmetry occurs because most polar amino acids are better able to snorkel their polar atoms away from the membrane core at the N terminus than at the C terminus. Two findings lead us to this proposition: (1) side-chain conformations are influenced strongly by the N or C-terminal position of the amino acid in the bilayer, and (2) the favored snorkeling direction of an amino acid correlates well with its N to C-terminal composition bias. Our results suggest that TM helix predictions should incorporate an N to C-terminal composition bias, that rotamer preferences of TM side-chains are position-dependent, and that the ability to snorkel influences the evolutionary selection of amino acids for the helix N and C termini. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The glycine zipper has a significant structural impact, engendering a strong driving force for right-handed packing against a neighboring helix. Thus, the presence of a glycine zipper motif leads directly to testable structural hypotheses, particularly for a subclass of glycine zipper proteins that form channels. For example, we suggest that the membrane pores formed by the amyloid-beta peptide in vitro are constructed by glycine zipper packing and find that mutations in the glycine zipper motif block channel formation.

Recent studies suggest that tethering factors also positively regulate the assembly of functional SNARE complexes, thereby coupling tethering with fusion events. This coupling is mediated, at least in part, by direct physical interactions between tethering factors, SNAREs, and Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins.

 abstract = {Membrane proteins are a greasy lot. Thrown into water without detergents, they form intractable aggregates, which minimize exposure of their nonpolar transmem- brane surfaces to water. Aggregation would be their cer- tain fate if membrane proteins were translated on the ribosome in the manner of soluble proteins. But this fate is avoided: the elongating polypeptide segment from the ribosome exit tunnel (Voss et al., 2006) passes into the membrane-dwelling translocon assembly whose architecture permits selected segments to enter the membrane bilayer to become transmembrane (TM) he- lices (for review see White and von Heijne, 2004, 2005; von Heijne, 2006). The principles underlying this selec- tion process are beginning to emerge from our recent studies of the recognition of transmembrane helices by the ER translocon (Hessa et al., 2005a; Meindl-Beinker et al., 2006). As Gunnar von Heijne discusses in his Per- spective (p. 353), one outcome of our experiments was a “biological” hydrophobicity scale that describes the apparent free energy of insertion (∆Gapp) of each of the 20 natural amino acids when located in the center of a hydrophobic TM helix. This biological scale correlated strongly with the so-called Wimley-White (1999) physical hydrophobicity scales, suggesting that, somehow, the translocon selection of TM segments fol- lows general thermodynamic principles that underlie partitioning of peptides between water and n-octanol (Wimley et al., 1996). The primary goal of this Perspec- tive is to explore this intriguing nexus between biology and physical chemistry. One of the motivations for this series of Perspectives is to gain deeper insights into the connection between the biological hydrophobicity scale and physical scales, especially the Wimley-White (1999) octanol scale. Our current understanding of membranes, hydrophobicity, and membrane protein stability originates from the Fluid Mosaic Membrane Model (Singer and Nicolson, 1972). I therefore begin by reviewing the origins of this conceptual model, which is built upon the fundamental idea that hydrophobic molecules (e.g., membrane pro- teins) partition between water and immiscible nonpolar phases (e.g., lipid bilayers). Because this concept arose before our understanding of the structure and dynamics of fluid bilayers was complete, I next discuss the mod- ern view of lipid bilayer structure and dynamics, which is essential for connecting the biological and physical scales. Implicit in the motivation for this Perspectives series is the apparent ability of the translocon to insert charge-containing TM helices across the ER membrane. I discuss how this might work in the light of the modern view of bilayer structure. This sets the stage for consid- ering why the biological hydrophobicity scale correlates so strongly with the Wimley-White octanol scale. I at- tempt to provide an explanation. To begin to connect the biological and physical hydrophobicity scales, I then discuss insights into translocon function obtained from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of SecY/Sec61 heterotrimer in lipid bilayers. I argue that the heterotri- mer is ideally suited to serve as a thermodynamic switch that determines whether or not a polypeptide segment passes into the lipid bilayer as a TM segment. Finally, I consider whether TM helix recognition by the translo- con is equivalent to direct partitioning of helices be- tween water and lipid bilayer.},[m

 abstract = {We propose that the initial event in the secretion of proteins across membranes and their insertion into membranes is the spontaneous penetration of the hydrophobic portion of the bilayer by a helical hairpin. Energetic considerations of polypeptide structures in a nonpolar, lipid environment compared with an aqueous environment suggest that only $\alpha$ and 310helices will be observed in the hydrophobic interior of membranes. Insertion of a polypeptide is accomplished by a hairpin structure composed of two helices, which will partition into membranes if the free energy arising from burying hydrophobic helical surfaces exceeds the free energy "cost" of burying potentially charged and hydrogen-bonding groups. We suggest, for example, that the hydrophobic leader peptide found in secreted proteins and in many membrane proteins forms one of these helices and is oriented in the membrane with its N terminus inside. In secreted proteins, the leader functions by pulling polar portions of a protein into the membrane as the second helix of the hairpin. The occurrence of all categories of membrane proteins can be rationalized by the hydrophobic or hydrophilic character of the two helices of the inserted hairpin and, for some integral membrane proteins, by events in which a single terminal helix is inserted. We propose that, because of the distribution of polar and nonpolar sequences in the polypeptide sequence, secretion and the insertion of membrane proteins are spontaneous processes that do not require the participation of additional specific membrane receptors or transport proteins. {\textcopyright} 1981.},[m

 abstract = {$\alpha$-Helical hairpins, consisting of a pair of closely spaced transmembrane (TM) helices that are connected by a short interfacial turn, are the simplest structural motifs found in multi-spanning membrane proteins. In naturally occurring hairpins, the presence of polar residues is common and predicted to complicate membrane insertion. We postulate that the pre-packing process offsets any energetic cost of allocating polar and charged residues within the hydrophobic environment of biological membranes. Consistent with this idea, we provide here experimental evidence demonstrating that helical hairpin insertion into biological membranes can be driven by electrostatic interactions between closely separated, poorly hydrophobic sequences. Additionally, we observe that the integral hairpin can be stabilized by a short loop heavily populated by turn-promoting residues. We conclude that the combined effect of TM-TM electrostatic interactions and tight turns plays an important role in generating the functional architecture of membrane proteins and propose that helical hairpin motifs can be acquired within the context of the Sec61 translocon at the early stages of membrane protein biosynthesis. Taken together, these data further underline the potential complexities involved in accurately predicting TM domains from primary structures. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on this analysis, preproteins fall into three distinct classes: SRP dependent, SRP independent, and those that can use both pathways.

 abstract = {Small multidrug resistance (SMR) transport proteins provide a model for the evolution of larger two-domain transport proteins. The orientation in the membrane of 27 proteins from the SMR family was determined using the reporter fusion technique. Nine members were encoded monocistronically (singles) and shown to insert in both orientations (dual topology). Eighteen members were encoded in pairs on the chromosome and shown to insert in fixed orientations; the two proteins in each pair invariably had opposite orientations in the membrane. Interaction between the two proteins in pairs was demonstrated by copurification. The orientation in the membrane of either protein in the pair was affected only marginally by the presence of the other protein.For the proteins in pairs, the orientation in the membrane correlated well with the distribution of positively charges residues (R. +. K) over the cytoplasmic and extracellular loops (positive-inside rule). In contrast, dual-topology insertion of the singles was predicted less well by the positive-inside rule. Three singles were predicted to insert in a single orientation with the N-terminus and the C-terminus at the extracellular side of the membrane. Analysis of charge distributions suggests the requirement of a threshold number of charges in the cytoplasmic loops for the positive-inside rule to be of predictive value. It is concluded that a combined analysis of gene organization on the chromosome and phylogeny is sufficient to distinguish between fixed or dual topology of SMR members and, probably, similar types of membrane proteins. The positive-inside rule can be used to predict the orientation of members in pairs, but is not suitable as a sole predictor of dual topology. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},[m

 abstract = {The translocon recognizes transmembrane helices with sufficient level of hydrophobicity and inserts them into the membrane. However, sometimes less hydrophobic helices are also recognized. Positive inside rule, orientational preferences of and specific interactions with neighboring helices have been shown to aid in the recognition of these helices, at least in artificial systems. To better understand how the translocon inserts marginally hydrophobic helices, we studied three naturally occurring marginally hydrophobic helices, which were previously shown to require the subsequent helix for efficient translocon recognition. We find no evidence for specific interactions when we scan all residues in the subsequent helices. Instead, we identify arginines located at the N-terminal part of the subsequent helices that are crucial for the recognition of the marginally hydrophobic transmembrane helices, indicating that the positive inside rule is important. However, in two of the constructs, these arginines do not aid in the recognition without the rest of the subsequent helix; that is, the positive inside rule alone is not sufficient. Instead, the improved recognition of marginally hydrophobic helices can here be explained as follows: the positive inside rule provides an orientational preference of the subsequent helix, which in turn allows the marginally hydrophobic helix to be inserted; that is, the effect of the positive inside rule is stronger if positively charged residues are followed by a transmembrane helix. Such a mechanism obviously cannot aid C-terminal helices, and consequently, we find that the terminal helices in multi-spanning membrane proteins are more hydrophobic than internal helices. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},[m

Each TM interacted with and moved through the translocon in a highly ordered and sequential fashion. Strong asymmetric Sec61alpha cross-linking was observed for only one helix at a time, suggesting the presence of a single primary binding site. However, up to four TMs simultaneously contacted Sec61alpha from different molecular environments. Thus, AQP4 integration by Sec61alpha involves sequential triage of TMs from their initial portal of entry into multiple secondary sites within the translocon.

A central constriction of six apolar residues has been shown to form a seal, but also to determine the hydrophobicity threshold for membrane integration: Mutation of these residues in yeast Sec61p to glycines, serines, aspartates, or lysines lowered the hydrophobicity required for integration; mutation to alanines increased it. Whereas four leucines distributed in an oligo-alanine H segment were sufficient for 50{\%} integration, we now find four leucines in the N-terminal half of the H segment to produce significantly more integration than in the C-terminal half, suggesting functional asymmetry within the translocon. Scanning a cluster of three leucines through an oligo-alanine H segment showed high integration levels, except around the position matching that of the hydrophobic constriction in the pore where integration was strongly reduced. Both asymmetry and the position effect of H-segment integration disappeared upon mutation of the constriction residues to glycines or serines, demonstrating that hydrophobicity at this position within the translocon is responsible for the phenomenon. Asymmetry was largely retained, however, when constriction residues were replaced by alanines. These results reflect on the integration mechanism of transmembrane domains and show that membrane insertion of H segments strongly depends not only on their intrinsic hydrophobicity but also on the local conditions in the translocon interior. Thus, the contribution of hydrophobic residues in the H segment is not simply additive and displays cooperativeness depending on their relative position.},[m

 abstract = {A conserved heterotrimeric membrane protein complex, the Sec61 or SecY complex, forms a protein-conducting channel, allowing polypeptides to be transferred across or integrated into membranes. We report the crystal structure of the complex from Methanococcus jannaschii at a resolution of 3.2 A. The structure suggests that one copy of the heterotrimer serves as a functional translocation channel. The alpha-subunit has two linked halves, transmembrane segments 1-5 and 6-10, clamped together by the gamma-subunit. A cytoplasmic funnel leading into the channel is plugged by a short helix. Plug displacement can open the channel into an 'hourglass' with a ring of hydrophobic residues at its constriction. This ring may form a seal around the translocating polypeptide, hindering the permeation of other molecules. The structure also suggests mechanisms for signal-sequence recognition and for the lateral exit of transmembrane segments of nascent membrane proteins into lipid, and indicates binding sites for partners that provide the driving force for translocation.},[m

An increasing number of reports indicate that cellular processes are underpinned by regulated interactions between these proteins. Consequently, functional studies of these networks at a molecular level require co-reconstitution of the interacting components. Here, we report a SNARE protein-based method for incorporation of multiple membrane proteins into artificial membrane vesicles of well-defined composition, and for delivery of large water-soluble substrates into these vesicles. The approach is used for in vitro reconstruction of a fully functional bacterial respiratory chain from purified components. Furthermore, the method is used for functional incorporation of the entire F1F0 ATP synthase complex into native bacterial membranes from which this component had been genetically removed. The novel methodology offers a tool to investigate complex interaction networks between membrane-bound proteins at a molecular level, which is expected to generate functional insights into key cellular functions.},[m

The concepts of hydrophobic matching and curvature stress are revisited in light of recent data obtained from experimental and theoretical studies which demonstrate that not only do integral proteins perturb the lipids, but the physical state of the lipids does also actively influence protein function. The case of the trans-membrane water-channel protein aquaporin GlpF from E. coli imbedded in lipid-bilayer membranes is discussed in some detail. Numerical data obtained from Molecular Dynamics simulations show on the one side that the lipid bilayer adapts to the channel by a hydrophobic matching condition which reflects the propensity of the lipid molecules for forming curved structures. On the other side, it is demonstrated that the transport function of the channel is modulated by the matching condition and/or the curvature stress in a lipid-specific manner. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {Biological membranes are characterized by a heterogeneous composition, which is not only manifested in the wide variety of their components, but also in aspects like the lateral organization, topology, and conformation of proteins and lipids. In bringing about the correct membrane structure, protein-lipid interactions can be expected to play a prominent role. The extent of hydrophobic matching between transmembrane protein segments and lipids potentially constitutes a versatile director of membrane organization, because a tendency to avoid hydrophobic mismatch could result in compensating adaptations such as tilt of the transmembrane segment or segregation into distinct domains. Also, interfacial interactions between lipid headgroups and the aromatic and charged residues that typically flank transmembrane domains may act as an organizing element. In this review, we discuss the numerous model studies that have systematically explored the influence of hydrophobic matching and interfacial anchoring on membrane structure. Designed peptides consisting of a polyleucine or polyleucine/alanine hydrophobic stretch, which is flanked on both sides by tryptophan or lysine residues, reflect the general layout of transmembrane protein segments. It is shown for phosphatidylcholine bilayers and for other model membranes that these peptides adapt a transmembrane topology without extensive peptide or lipid adaptations under conditions of hydrophobic matching, but that significant rearrangements can result from hydrophobic mismatch. Moreover, these effects depend on the nature of the flanking residues, implying a modulation of the mismatch response by interfacial interactions of the flanking residues. The implications of these model studies for the organization of biomembranes are discussed in the context of recent experiments with more complex systems.},[m

 abstract = {The {\{}MOM{\}} (mitochondrial outer membrane) contains {\{}SA{\}} (signal-anchored) proteins that bear at their N-terminus a single hydrophobic segment that serves as both a mitochondrial targeting signal and an anchor at the membrane. These proteins, like the vast majority of mitochondrial proteins, are encoded in the nucleus and have to be imported into the organelle. Currently, the mechanisms by which they are targeted to and inserted into the {\{}OM{\}} (outer membrane) are unclear. To shed light on these issues, we employed a recombinant version of the {\{}SA{\}} protein {\{}OM45{\}} and a synthetic peptide corresponding to its signal-anchor segment. Both forms are associated with isolated mitochondria independently of cytosolic factors. Interaction with mitochondria was diminished when a mutated form of the signal-anchor was employed. We demonstrate that the signal-anchor peptide acquires an {\{}{\&}{\#}x3B1;-helical{\}} structure in a lipid environment and adopted a {\{}TM{\}} (transmembrane) topology within artificial lipid bilayers. Moreover, the peptide's affinity to artificial membranes with {\{}OM-like{\}} lipid composition was much higher than that of membranes with {\{}ER{\}} (endoplasmic reticulum)-like lipid composition. Collectively, our results suggest that {\{}SA{\}} proteins are specifically inserted into the {\{}MOM{\}} by a process that is not dependent on additional proteins, but is rather facilitated by the distinct lipid composition of this membrane.},[m

 abstract = {The signal recognition particle (SRP) cotranslationally recognizes signal sequences of secretory proteins and targets ribosome-nascent chain complexes to the SRP receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, initiating translocation of the nascent chain through the Sec61 translocon. Although signal sequences do not have homology, they have similar structural regions: a positively charged N-terminus, a hydrophobic core and a more polar C-terminal region that contains the cleavage site for the signal peptidase. Here, we have used site-specific photocrosslinking to study SRP-signal sequence interactions. A photoreactive probe was incorporated into the middle of wild-type or mutated signal sequences of the secretory protein preprolactin by in vitro translation of mRNAs containing an amber-stop codon in the signal peptide in the presence of the N$\epsilon$-(5-azido-2 nitrobenzoyl)-Lys-tRNAambamber suppressor. A homogeneous population of SRP-ribosome-nascent chain complexes was obtained by the use of truncated mRNAs in translations performed in the presence of purified canine SRP. Quantitative analysis of the photoadducts revealed that charged residues at the N-terminus of the signal sequence or in the early part of the mature protein have only a mild effect on the SRP-signal sequence association. However, deletions of amino acid residues in the hydrophobic portion of the signal sequence severely affect SRP binding. The photocrosslinking data correlate with targeting efficiency and translocation across the membrane. Thus, the hydrophobic core of the signal sequence is primarily responsible for its recognition and binding by SRP, while positive charges fine-tune the SRP-signal sequence affinity and targeting to the translocon.},[m

 abstract = {Translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an initial and crucial biogenesis step for all secreted and endomembrane proteins in eukaryotes. ER insertion can take place through the well-characterized signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent pathway or the less-studied route of SRP-independent translocation. To better understand the prevalence of the SRP-independent pathway, we systematically defined the translocational dependence of the yeast secretome. By combining hydropathy-based analysis and microscopy, we uncovered that a previously unappreciated fraction of the yeast secretome translocates without the aid of the SRP. Furthermore, we validated a family of SRP-independent substrates - the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins. Studying this family, we identified a determinant for ER targeting and uncovered a network of cytosolic proteins that facilitate SRP-independent targeting and translocation. These findings highlight the underappreciated complexity of SRP-independent translocation, which enables this pathway to efficiently cope with its extensive substrate flux. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},[m

 abstract = {Motivation: Accurate prediction of contacts between $\beta$-strand residues can significantly contribute towards ab initio prediction of the 3D structure of many proteins. Contacts in the same protein are highly interdependent. Therefore, significant improvements can be expected by applying statistical relational learners that overcome the usual machine learning assumption that examples are independent and identically distributed. Furthermore, the dependencies among $\beta$-residue contacts are subject to strong regularities, many of which are known a priori. In this article, we take advantage of Markov logic, a statistical relational learning framework that is able to capture dependencies between contacts, and constrain the solution according to domain knowledge expressed by means of weighted rules in a logical language.Results: We introduce a novel hybrid architecture based on neural and Markov logic networks with grounding-specific weights. On a non-redundant dataset, our method achieves 44.9{\%} F1 measure, with 47.3{\%} precision and 42.7{\%} recall, which is significantly better (P {\textless} 0.01) than previously reported performance obtained by 2D recursive neural networks. Our approach also significantly improves the number of chains for which $\beta$-strands are nearly perfectly paired (36{\%} of the chains are predicted with F1 ≥ 70{\%} on coarse map). It also outperforms more general contact predictors on recent CASP 2008 targets.Contact: lippi@dsi.unifi.itSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. },[m

 abstract = {One strategy employed by bacterial strains to resist $\beta$-lactam antibiotics is the expression of metallo-$\beta$-lactamases requiring Zn2+for activity. In the last few years, many new zinc $\beta$-lactamases have been described and several pathogens are now known to synthesize members of this class. Metallo-$\beta$-lactamases are especially worrisome due to: (1) their broad activity profiles that encompass most $\beta$-lactam antibiotics, including the carbapenems; (2) potential for horizontal transference; and (3) the absence of clinically useful inhibitors. On the basis of the known sequences, three different lineages, identified as subclasses B1, B2, and B3 have been characterized. The three-dimensional structure of at least one metallo-$\beta$-lactamase of each subclass has been solved. These very similar 3D structures are characterized by the presence of an $\alpha$$\beta$$\beta$$\alpha$-fold. In addition to metallo-$\beta$-lactamases which cleave the amide bond of the $\beta$-lactam ring, the metallo-$\beta$-lactamase superfamily includes enzymes which hydrolyze thiol-ester, phosphodiester and sulfuric ester bonds as well as oxydoreductases. Most of the 6000 members of this superfamily share five conserved motifs, the most characteristic being the His116-X-His118-X-Asp120-His121 signature. They all exhibit an $\alpha$$\beta$$\beta$$\alpha$-fold, similar to that found in the structure of zinc $\beta$-lactamases. Many members of this superfamily are involved in mRNA maturation and DNA reparation. This fact suggests the hypothesis that metallo-$\beta$-lactamases may be the result of divergent evolution starting from an ancestral protein which did not have a $\beta$-lactamase activity. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

 abstract = {The expansion of functions in an enzyme superfamily is thought to occur through recruitment of latent promiscuous functions within existing enzymes. Thus, the promiscuous activities of enzymes represent connections between different catalytic landscapes and provide an additional layer of evolutionary connectivity between functional families alongside their sequence and structural relationships. Functional connectivity has been observed between individual functional families; however, little is known about how catalytic landscapes are connected throughout a highly diverged superfamily. Here, we describe a superfamily-wide analysis of evolutionary and functional connectivity in the metallo-$\beta$-lactamase (MBL) superfamily. We investigated evolutionary connections between functional families and related evolutionary to functional connectivity; 24 enzymes from 15 distinct functional families were challenged against 10 catalytically distinct reactions. We revealed that enzymes of this superfamily are generally promiscuous, as each enzyme catalyzes on average 1.5 reactions in addition to its native one. Catalytic landscapes in the MBL superfamily overlap substantially; each reaction is connected on average to 3.7 other reactions whereas some connections appear to be unrelated to recent evolutionary events and occur between chemically distinct reactions. These findings support the idea that the highly distinct reactions in the MBL superfamily could have evolved from a common ancestor traversing a continuous network via promiscuous enzymes. Several functional connections (e.g., the lactonase/phosphotriesterase and phosphonatase/phosphodiesterase/arylsulfatase reactions) are also observed in structurally and evolutionary distinct superfamilies, suggesting that these catalytic landscapes are substantially connected. Our results show that new enzymatic functions could evolve rapidly from the current diversity of enzymes and range of promiscuous activities. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},[m

 abstract = {Erythromycin resistance in Campylobacter coli from meat animals is frequently encountered and could represent a substantial barrier to antibiotic treatment of human infections. Erythromycin resistance in this organism has been associated with a point mutation (A2075G) in the 23S rRNA gene. However, the mecha-nisms responsible for possible dissemination of erythromycin resistance in C. coli remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated transformation-mediated acquisition of erythromycin resistance by genotypically diverse C. coli strains from turkeys and swine, with total genomic DNA from erythromycin-resistant C. coli of either turkey or swine origin used as a donor. Overall, transformation to erythromycin resistance was significantly more frequent in C. coli strains from turkeys than in swine-derived strains (P {\textless} 0.01). The frequency of transformation to erythromycin resistance was 10 ؊5 to 10 ؊6 for turkey-derived strains but 10 ؊7 or less for C. coli from swine. Transformants harbored the point mutation A2075G in the 23S rRNA gene, as did the erythromycin-resistant strains used as DNA donors. Erythromycin resistance was stable in transfor-mants following serial transfers in the absence of the antibiotic, and most transformants had high MICs ({\textgreater}256 ␮g/ml), as did the C. coli donor strains. In contrast to the results obtained with transformation, spontaneous mutants had relatively low erythromycin MICs (32 to 64 ␮g/ml) and lacked the A2075G mutation in the 23S rRNA gene. These findings suggest that natural transformation has the potential to contribute to the dissem-ination of high-level resistance to erythromycin among C. coli strains colonizing meat animals.},[m

 abstract = {The OB-fold is a small, versatile single-domain protein binding module that occurs in all forms of life, where it binds protein, carbohydrate, nucleic acid and small-molecule ligands. We have exploited this natural plasticity to engineer a new class of non-immunoglobulin alternatives to antibodies with unique structural and biophysical characteristics. We present here the engineering of the OB-fold anticodon recognition domain from aspartyl tRNA synthetase taken from the thermophile Pyrobaculum aerophilum. For this single-domain scaffold we have coined the term OBody. Starting from a na{\"{i}}ve combinatorial library, we engineered an OBody with 3 nM affinity for hen egg-white lysozyme, by optimising the affinity of a na{\"{i}}ve OBody 11,700-fold over several affinity maturation steps, using phage display. At each maturation step a crystal structure of the engineered OBody in complex with hen egg-white lysozyme was determined, showing binding elements in atomic detail. These structures have given us an unprecedented insight into the directed evolution of affinity for a single antigen on the molecular scale. The engineered OBodies retain the high thermal stability of the parental OB-fold despite mutation of up to 22{\%} of their residues. They can be expressed in soluble form and also purified from bacteria at high yields. They also lack disulfide bonds. These data demonstrate the potential of OBodies as a new scaffold for the engineering of specific binding reagents and provide a platform for further development of future OBody-based applications.},[m

 abstract = {Natural genetic transformation is the active uptake of free DNA by bacterial cells and the heritable incorporation of its genetic information. Since the famous discovery of transformation in Streptococcus pneumoniae by Griffith in 1928 and the demonstration of DNA as the transforming principle by Avery and coworkers in 1944, cellular processes involved in transformation have been studied extensively by in vitro experimentation with a few transformable species. Only more recently has it been considered that transformation may be a powerful mechanism of horizontal gene transfer in natural bacterial populations. In this review the current understanding of the biology of transformation is summarized to provide the platform on which aspects of bacterial transformation in water, soil, and sediments and the habitat of pathogens are discussed. Direct and indirect evidence for gene transfer routes by transformation within species and between different species will be presented, along with data suggesting that plasmids as well as chromosomal DNA are subject to genetic exchange via transformation. Experiments exploring the prerequisites for transformation in the environment, including the production and persistence of free DNA and factors important for the uptake of DNA by cells, will be compiled, as well as possible natural barriers to transformation. The efficiency of gene transfer by transformation in bacterial habitats is possibly genetically adjusted to submaximal levels. The fact that natural transformation has been detected among bacteria from all trophic and taxonomic groups including archaebacteria suggests that transformability evolved early in phylogeny. Probable functions of DNA uptake other than gene acquisition will be discussed. The body of information presently available suggests that transformation has a great impact on bacterial population dynamics as well as on bacterial evolution and speciation.},[m

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identification of DNA-binding proteins is one of the major challenges in the field of genome annotation, as these proteins play a crucial role in gene-regulation. In this paper, we developed various SVM modules for predicting DNA-binding domains and proteins. All models were trained and tested on multiple datasets of non-redundant proteins. RESULTS: SVM models have been developed on DNAaset, which consists of 1153 DNA-binding and equal number of non DNA-binding proteins, and achieved the maximum accuracy of 72.42{\%} and 71.59{\%} using amino acid and dipeptide compositions, respectively. The performance of SVM model improved from 72.42{\%} to 74.22{\%}, when evolutionary information in form of PSSM profiles was used as input instead of amino acid composition. In addition, SVM models have been developed on DNAset, which consists of 146 DNA-binding and 250 non-binding chains/domains, and achieved the maximum accuracy of 79.80{\%} and 86.62{\%} using amino acid composition and PSSM profiles. The SVM models developed in this study perform better than existing methods on a blind dataset. CONCLUSION: A highly accurate method has been developed for predicting DNA-binding proteins using SVM and PSSM profiles. This is the first study in which evolutionary information in form of PSSM profiles has been used successfully for predicting DNA-binding proteins. A web-server DNAbinder has been developed for identifying DNA-binding proteins and domains from query amino acid sequences http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/dnabinder/.},[m

Users can also retrieve glycan tree structures in KCF format from their local computers for visualization over the web. The tree-matching algorithm provides several options for performing different types of tree-matching procedures on glycans. These options consist of whether to incorporate gaps in a match, whether to take the linkage information into consideration and local versus global alignment. The results of this program are returned as a list of glycan structures in order of similarity based on these options. The actual alignment can be viewed graphically, and the annotation information can also be viewed easily since all this information is linked with KEGG's comprehensive suite of genomic data. Analogously to BLAST, users are thus able to compare glycan structures of interest with glycans from different glycan databases using a variety of tree-alignment options.

The OCs were constructed by applying the quasi-clique-based clustering method to all possible protein coding genes in all complete genomes, based on their amino acid sequence similarities. It is computationally efficient to calculate OCs, which enables to regularly update the contents. KEGG OC has the following two features: (i) It consists of all complete genomes of a wide variety of organisms from three domains of life, and the number of organisms is the largest among the existing databases; and (ii) It is compatible with the KEGG database by sharing the same sets of genes and identifiers, which leads to seamless integration of OCs with useful components in KEGG such as biological pathways, pathway modules, functional hierarchy, diseases and drugs.

 abstract = {Although more than a dozen new proteins are produced when Streptococcus pneumoniae cells become competent for genetic transformation, only a few of the corresponding genes have been identified to date. To find genes responsible for the production of competence-specific proteins, a random lacZ transcriptional fusion library was constructed in S. pneumoniae by using the insertional lacZ reporter vector pEVP3. Screening the library for clones with competence-specific beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) production yielded three insertion mutants with induced beta-Gal levels of about 4, 10, and 40 Miller units. In all three clones, activation of the lacZ reporter correlated with competence and depended on competence-stimulating peptide. Chromosomal loci adjacent to the integrated vector were subcloned from the insertion mutants, and their nucleotide sequences were determined. Genes at two of the loci exhibited strong similarity to parts of Bacillus subtilis com operons. One locus contained open reading frames (ORFs) homologous to the comEA and comEC genes in B. subtilis but lacked a comEB homolog. A second locus contained four ORFs with homology to the B. subtilis comG gene ORFs 1 to 4, but comG gene ORFs 5 to 7 were replaced in S. pneumoniae with an ORF encoding a protein homologous to transport ATP-binding proteins. Genes at all three loci were confirmed to be required for transformation by mutagenesis using pEVP3 for insertion duplications or an erm cassette for gene disruptions.},[m

 abstract = {Clobins have remarkable sequence diversity, and yet maintain a common fold. In spite of the diversity, there are highly-conserved residues at several sites. The conserved residues were examined in terms of the structural stability, by employing the pseudo-energy functions of the structure/sequence compatibility method. The fitness of each residue type to the structural environment was evaluated at seven highly-conserved sites: the Leu (at the B10 site), Phe (CD1), and Leu (F4) residues were found to fit their respective sites due to hydrophobic interactions; Pro (C2) stabilizes the N-terminal edge of an $\alpha$-helical structure; and Phe (CD4) is stabilized by backbone hydrogen-bonding to Phe (CD1). On the other hand, the other two residues, His (E7) and His (F8), are poorly suited to the sites from a structural viewpoint, suggesting that their conservation clearly results from a heme-related functional requirement. The invariant Phe residue (CD1) has been suggested to be important for supporting the heme. The present analysis revealed that this residue is also well suited to the site in terms of energy.},[m

DBSI was trained and validated on a data set of 263 proteins (TRAIN-263), tested on an independent set of protein-DNA complexes (TEST-206) and data sets of 29 unbound (APO-29) and 30 bound (HOLO-30) protein structures distinct from the training data. We computed 480 candidate features for identifying protein residues that bind DNA, including new features that capture the electrostatic microenvironment within shells near the protein surface. Our iterative feature selection process identified features important in other models, as well as features unique to the DBSI model, such as a banded electrostatic feature with spatial separation comparable with the canonical width of the DNA minor groove. Validations and comparisons with established methods using a range of performance metrics clearly demonstrate the predictive advantage of DBSI, and its comparable performance on unbound (APO-29) and bound (HOLO-30) conformations demonstrates robustness to binding-induced protein conformational changes. Finally, we offer our feature data table to others for integration into their own models or for testing improved feature selection and model training strategies based on DBSI.},[m

 abstract = {Genetic transformation is widely utilized in molecular biology as a tool for gene cloning in Escherichia coli and for gene mapping in Bacillus subtilis. Several strains of eubacteria can naturally take up exogenous DNA and integrate the DNA into their own genomes. Molecular details of natural transformation, however, remained to be elucidated. The complete genome of a cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, has been sequenced. This bacterium has been used to examine functions of a particular gene. The genome is considered to carry information on natural transformable characteristics of Synechocystis. The first step in genetic transformation is the uptake of exogenous DNA. Proteins with non-specific DNA binding features are required, because specificity in the exogenous DNA has not been demonstrated. Such proteins have modules interacting with the phosphate backbone of DNA, including helix-turn-helix modules. Using a consensus pattern of the phosphate-binding helix-turn-helix module, we searched through the genome data of Synechocystis for genes or open reading frame (ORF) products with the pattern in primary structures. We found that an ORF, slr0197, has the pattern in duplicate at the C-terminal region. We also found that the ORF product has a hydrophobic segment at the N-terminal region, which is followed by two internal repeats of the endonuclease domain. Based on these observations, we propose a model for the initial stage of genetic transformation. This is apparently the first report on molecular mechanisms of natural transformation.},[m

Previous work has shown that RecA, ComGA, ComFA and SsbB are directed to the cell poles in competent cells, and that the uptake of transforming DNA occurs preferentially at the poles. We show that ComGA, ComFA, DprA (Smf), SsbB (YwpH), RecA and YjbF (CoiA) are located at the cell poles, where they appear to colocalize. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we have shown that these six competent (Com) proteins reside in close proximity to one another. This conclusion was supported by the effects of com gene knockouts on the stabilities of Com proteins. Data obtained from the com gene knockout studies, as well as information from other sources, extend the list of proteins in the transformation complex to include ComEC and ComEA. Because ComGA and ComFA are membrane-associated, while DprA, SsbB, RecA and YjbF are soluble, a picture emerges of a large multiprotein polar complex, involving both cytosolic and membrane proteins. This complex mediates the binding and uptake of single-stranded DNA, the protection of this DNA from cellular nucleases and its recombination with the recipient chromosome.},[m

In contrast, the complex molecular machines that mediate conjugation and genetic transformation drive the transport of single stranded DNA. The transformation machine also processes this internalized DNA and mediates its recombination with the resident chromosome during and after uptake, whereas the conjugation apparatus processes DNA before transfer.

 abstract = {A Bacillus subtilis gene, required for genetic competence, was identified immediately upstream from the previously characterized gene comA. The comA gene product has been found to exhibit amino acid sequence similarity to the so-called effector class of signal-transduction proteins. DNA sequencing of the new determinant, named comP, revealed that the carboxy-terminal domain of the predicted ComP protein is similar in amino acid sequence to that of several sensor members of the bacterial two-component signal-transduction systems. The predicted amino-terminal domain contains several hydrophobic segments, postulated to be membrane-spanning. In vitro-derived comP disruptions are epistatic on the expression of all late competence genes tested, including comG, comC, comD, and comE, but not on expression of the early gene comB. Although comA has its own promoter, some transcription of comA, especially later in growth, occurs via readthrough from comP sequences. A roughly twofold epistatic effect of a comP disruption was noted on the downstream comA determinant, possibly due to interruption of readthrough transcription from comP to comA. Overexpression of comA fully restored competence to a comP mutant, providing evidence that ComA acts after ComP, and consistent with a role for the latter protein in activation of the former, possibly by phosphorylation. ComP probably is involved in transmitting information concerning the nutritional status of the medium, particularly the presence of nitrogen- and carbon-containing nutrients. ComP was also shown to play a role in sporulation, at least partly interchangeable with that of SpoIIJ, another putative sensor protein.},[m

A minor promoter also is responsible for transcription of ORF2 and -3. A transcript containing a single ORF is produced in the reverse direction. The reverse ORF overlaps ORF1 and the untranslated comE leader. The comE transcript is present at a very low level during growth and at an elevated level in stationary-phase cells. Conversely, the reverse transcript is present during exponential growth and disappears during stationary phase. The reverse ORF resembles prokaryotic and eukaryotic pyrroline-5'-carboxylate reductases, while ORF2 is similar to several dCMP deaminases.

The hydrophilic segments of these membrane proteins, which undergo export, display a characteristic charge profile where intermembrane space-localized segments bear a net negative charge, whereas those remaining in the matrix have a net positive one. Using a model protein, preSu9(1-112)-dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which undergoes Oxa1p-mediated N-tail export, we demonstrate here that the net charge of N- and C-flanking regions of the transmembrane domain play a critical role in determining the orientation of the insertion process. The N-tail must bear a net negative charge to be exported to the intermembrane space. Furthermore, a net positive charge of the C-terminal region supports this N-tail export event. These data provide experimental evidence that protein export in mitochondria adheres to the "positive-inside" rule, described for sec-independent sorting of membrane proteins in prokaryotes. We propose here that the importance of a charge profile reflects a need for specific protein-protein interactions to occur in the export reaction, presumably at the level of the Oxa1p export machinery.},[m

[32m+[m[32mabstract = {Membrane proteins represent a large proportion of the proteome, but have characteristics that are problematic for many methods in modern molecular biology (that have often been developed with soluble proteins in mind). For structural studies, low levels of expression and the presence of detergent have been thorns in the flesh of the membrane protein experimentalist. Here we discuss the use of cryo-electron microscopy in breakthrough studies of the structures of membrane proteins. This method can cope with relatively small quantities of sample and with the presence of detergent. Until recently, cryo-electron microscopy could not deliver high-resolution structures of membrane proteins, but recent developments in transmission electron microscope technology and in the image processing of single particles imaged in the microscope have revolutionized the field, allowing high resolution structures to be obtained. Here we focus on the specific issues surrounding the application of cryo-electron microscopy to the study of membrane proteins, especially in the choice of a system to keep the protein soluble.},[m
