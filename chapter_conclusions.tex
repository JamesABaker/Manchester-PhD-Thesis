\chapter{Conclusions and outlook}
%The description of a~\gls{tmh} remains incomplete.
%The understanding of~\gls{tmp} topology is erroneous, and despite a wealth of structures, the general model of helix-helix and helix-lipid interactions remains speculative and requires a great deal of intensive analysis to generate a working model of a particular~\gls{tmp}.
\sloppy
As the idea of positive residues inside the cytoplasm emerged during the late 1980s, so did the idea of negative residues working in concert with~\gls{tmh} orientation.
It was shown that removing a single lysine residue reversed the topology of a model \textit{erichia coli} protein, whereas much higher numbers of negatively charged residues are needed to reverse topology~\cite{Nilsson1990}.
One would also expect to see a skew in negatively charged distribution if a cooperation between oppositely charged residues orientated a~\gls{tmh}, however there is no conclusive evidence in the literature for an opposing negatively charged skew~\cite{Granseth2005, Nilsson2005a, Sharpe2010, Baeza-Delgado2013, Pogozheva2013}.
However, in \textit{E.
coli} negative residues do experience electrical pulling forces when travelling through the SecYEG translocon indicating that negative charges are biologically relevant~\cite{Ismail2015}.
In this chapter, we explore the literature surrounding charged residue distribution in the~\gls{tmh}, and demonstrate that the ``negative-outside'' skew exists in anchoring~\gls{tmh}s
In this thesis we ellucidated the ``negative\--outside'' rule.
Additionally we have made observations regarding how anchoring \gls{tmh}s are optimised to their membranes.
This new insight into the bahviour of \gls{tmh}s will not only help us understand specific case in biology, but can also inform synthetic biology regarding \gls{tmp}s.

With respect to \gls{ta} \gls{tmp}s, we found differences between the mitochondrial and secretory dedtermined \gls{tmh}s.
We found alanine is used more commonly in the mitochondrial \gls{tmh}s, perhaps even moreso than isoleucine and leucine.
We also observed a reversal of the positive\--inside negative\--outside distributions of charged residues.
This re\--emphasises the notion that there is more to \gls{ta} protein trafficking than the hydrophobicity of the \gls{tmh} alone, and could inform more specific studies of individual proteins.
%\gls{ta} proteins in drug delivery
However, in order to reach more thorough conclusions at a molecular level, more annotation is needed in the databases regarding chaperone interactions, and a more precise terminology of what constitutes a post translationally inserted \gls{ta} protein.

Understanding cooperative \gls{tmh} insertion and the integration of marginally hydrophobic \gls{tmh}s will require a much more thorough understanding of the temporal aspects of the process. %EM and appears
However, understanding the relationship \gls{tmh}s have with one another is critical for developing complex synthetic \gls{tmp}s.
