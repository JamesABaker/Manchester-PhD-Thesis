Investigating the Recognition and Interactions of Non-Polar α Helices in
Biology
August 22, 2018

12

Abstract
Non–polar helices figure prominently in structural biology, from the first protein structure (myoglobin) through transmembrane segments, to current work on recognition of
protein trafficking and quality control. Transmembrane α helix containing proteins
make around a quarter of all proteins, as well as two-thirds of drug targets, and
contain some of the most critical proteins required for life as we know it. Yet they
are fundamentally difficult to study experimentally. This is in part due to the very
features that make them so biologically influential: their non–polar transmembrane
helix regions. What is missing in the current literature is a nuanced understanding
of the complexities of the helix composition beyond a hydrophobic region of around
20 residues. Currently, it is known that the properties of transmembrane protein α
helices underpin membrane protein insertion mechanisms.
By leveraging large data-sets of transmembrane proteins, this thesis is focused on
characterising features of α helices en masse, particularly regarding their topology,
membrane–protein interactions, and intramembrane protein interactions.
In this thesis, I make the argument that there are different classifications of transmembrane α helices. These have markedly different evolutionary pressures, these different classes interact differently with the membrane, and each class serve the protein
differently.

Lay Abstract
The survival of each of our cells relies on a cellular barrier to separate themselves from
the surrounding environment. The barrier works by being chemically very different
from both the outside environment and to the inside of the cell, which in both cases
are mostly water. The membrane is fatty, and because of that, the membrane repels
water.
Proteins are the molecular machinery that forms much of the cell structure and
shape as well as carrying out many of the cell’s routine tasks. Around a third of our
genome codes for proteins that are permanently embedded in the membrane. But
because these membrane-proteins are adapted for a life in the water repelling cell wall,
they are very hard to study in laboratories which often rely on methods that hold
proteins in water-based solutions.
In this thesis, we focus particularly on the parts of the protein that are embedded
in the water repelling cellular skin.
We computationally analysed the biochemical make-up of thousands of proteins
from openly available biological databases.
This thesis demonstrates three features of membrane proteins:
• the radically different evolutionary story that transmembrane regions have compared to other proteins; the sacrifices they make for their stability in order to
maintain their function, and their optimisation through evolutionary timescales
to adapt to the membrane as best they can.
• these membrane embedded regions cooperate with one another to make sure the
least stable, but functionally important, elements are correctly inserted into the
membrane.
• a distinct sub-group of membrane proteins that have a radically different
membrane-insertion mechanism (tail-anchored proteins) have adaptations in
their membrane regions depending on where they are in the cell.
These findings will go on to inform more specific studies about membrane proteins
and hopefully provide some insight to the workings of disease in which these membrane
proteins are a cause or a drug target.

Chapter 1
Introduction
Transmembrane (TM) biology is a huge and varied field that is ultimately the study of
the interface between compartments of the cell; one of the fundamental pillars of life
as we know it [1]. Transmembrane Protein (TMP)s include some of the most critical
to life proteins as well as a large number of drug targets. However, the experimental
inaccessibility of the TMH has hampered the progress of study compared to their
globular structural analogues. Despite progress over the last decade, the understanding
of the relationship between the sequence and function of a TMH is incomplete.
In this chapter we will place the TMH problem in context, then describe the important biological aspects of the TMH, and discuss tools and methods that allow us
to analyse and describe the nuanced differences between these TMH sequences.

The importance of transmembrane proteins

Membrane-bound proteins underpin almost every biological process directly, or indirectly, from photosynthesis to respiration. Integral TMPs are encoded by between
a third to a half of the genes in the human genome which reflects their biological
importance [2–4], and 40% of drug targets [Overington2006]. These proteins allow biochemical pathways that traverse the various biological membranes used in life.
Misfolding of these proteins during the complex process of translocation is common in

both normal and diseased cells [5], and mutations tend to cluster in TMH regions of
the genes [6]. This can result in a range of diseases including but not limited to cystic
fibrosis caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator [7], CharcotMarie-Tooth disease caused by mutations in the PMP22 gene [8] and the connexin 32
gene [9], diabetes insipidis caused by mutations the aquaporin 2 water channel [10],
retinitis pigmentosa caused by a point mutation in rhodopsin [11], and Neimann-Pick
disease that contains over 200 disease causing mutations identified [12–15]. Glycine
to arginine mutations occur statistically more frequently in TMHs than their globular
α-helix counterparts [16].

1.1.3

The transmembrane protein problem

Because of the experimental hindrance, TMP biology has been relatively slow to
emerge. Throughout the 1990s the concept of a TMH was simple and fairly assured:
they were greasy peptides of around 30Å in length, often bundled together and oriented perpendicularly to the membrane. By 2007, crystallography had elucidated 368
TMP structures from 148 unique proteins [Carpenter2007]. Whilst this growth was
exponential, at the same time there were in excess of 50,000 protein structures in the
PDB. Although the classic TMH structures were broadly prevalent, these structures
contained a plethora of unusual TMHs. Transmembrane Segment (TMS)s are capable of partial spanning of the membrane, spanning using oblique angles, and even
lying flat on the membrane surface [17, 18]; the classical model was incomplete. Even
recently, there is a contingency in the membrane biology field that despite progress
over the last decade there is still a lack of information regarding the relationship between TMH sequences and function, TMH structure, intra-membrane TMP assembly,
and the behaviour of TMHs in the lipid bilayer; the native biological environment of
TMHs [1].
Furthermore, the insertion and formation of the unusually orientated TMHs and
of the more traditional TMHs have been shown to be underpinned by complex thermodynamic equilibrium and electrostatic interactions [19–21]. As well as being a
biophysically convoluted system, TMHs are biologically functional beyond anchoring
in many cases. TMSs have been identified as regulators of protein quality control and

20

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

trafficking mechanisms, shifting the idea away from TMHs broadly exclusively functioning as anchors [22], and crucially this function beyond anchoring can be revealed
by sensitive, careful analysis of the sequence information alone [23].
When predicting the function of any protein, one follows the dicta that function
is facilitated by form, and form is determined by the sequence; the more similar the
sequences, the more likely that the function is similar. For globular soluble proteins having the same folds induces strict biochemical restrictions on the packing of a
hydrophobic protein core which requires similarity of non-polar residue patterns. Sequence analysis of non-globular TMPs has not been studied to nearly the same extent
yet homology paradigms are silently extended and applied to them. In the case of Signal Peptide (SP)s or TMSs the physical constraints are similar for all TMPs, and so
matching is indeed merely a reflection of the physical environment of the bilayer, not
the common ancestry. Worryingly, because of this oversight, it appears that between
2.1% and 13.6% of Pfam hits for SPs or TMSs are indeed false positive results [24].

1.1.4

The membrane protein revolution

Over the last decade or so, several significant steps have been made toward overcoming
the challenges in finding the structure of TMPs. Firstly, improvements in expression
and purification occured thanks to cleavable green fluorescent protein (allowing protein
tracking during purification) [Drew2005, Kawate2006] and antibody tagging for
purification [Eshagi2005] at the colony level [Cornvik2005] greatly increased the
throughput of TMPs.
Since folding of the TMP often depends on the lipid environment, and finding conditions that encourage protein stability was shown to improve crystallisation
[Carpenter2007, Rosenbusch2001]. The technology behind nanodiscs was originally published in 2002 [Bayburt2002]. The structure of the nanodisc is formed from
two scaffold peptide helices wrapped arround a group of self-associating phospholipids
(Figure 1.1A). The method was originally shown to be a viable method for obtaining native condition TMP crystals for cytochrome P450 [Duan2004]. Nanodiscs have
been routinely used to much more easily obtain crystal structures. Nanodiscs overcome
some of the major challenges caused by the hydrophobic helices and a more faithful
representation of the biological membranes than alternative model membranes like

liposomes [25].
Still the challenge remained of getting crystals of sufficient quality for x-ray diffraction.

Although many TMPs readily formed low resolution 2D crys-

tals for cryoEM[Vinothkumar2015, Raunser2009], and genome sequencing resulted in a exponential increase in structures derived from x-ray crystallography
[Vinothkumar2010], the dependency on crystallising TMPs has always resulted in
a hinderance.
In a full circle from EM study of the fluid mosaic model in the 1970s [26], once
more EM techniques were applied to TMPs as single molecules (Figure 1.1A). This
method escapes the need for TMP crystals [Vinothkumar2015] and the presence
of the sub 3Åstructures [Grant2015, Bartesaghi2015] utilising this method have
exceeded the near atomistic resolutions that were called a revolution in TMP biology
not a year ealier [Khlbrandt2014].

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

1.1.5

The role of bioinformatics in transmembrane biology

Due to the experimental difficulties of working with TMPs, often it is only possible
to experiment on the TMPs in silico, or at least common tasks that would involve
expensive time consuming processes become trivialised, for example identifying TM
regions in a protein of known sequence.
Traditionally, the role of bioinformatics has been to predict TM regions of a protein.
There are countless methods that can perform this. Many rely on statistical patterns
to identify TMHs such as the neural network approach of MEMSAT3 [27] Hidden
Markov models used in TMHMM [28], HMMTOP [29], S–TMHMM [30], OCTOPUS
[31], Phobius [32]. Unsatisfied with a statistical approach, Scampi seq [33] uses a first
principals method following the Kyte & Doolittle suggestion 26 years previously that
a biophysical scale can predict TMHs [34] and applies scoring based on the von Heijne
biological scale [35].
Predicting the presence of a typical TMH based on a protein sequence is currently
a fairly trivial task and typically relies on a consensus of several prediction softwares,
such as the automated TRANSMEM annotation used by UniProt [36]. Yet several
challenges remain in separating SPs from TMHs [37], correctly predicting the topology
of a TMP. There is also an issue of silent homology extension from α-helices. TMHs
share composition similarities due to membrane requirerments and restraints, not necessarily due to common ancestry, and it was found that many are often misreported
as homologous among distantly related proteins in Pfam[24]. Despite being able to
identify TMHs, our understanding of the specific biochemical role they play in the cell
often requires intense study. As more data is becoming availble bionformatic methods
that use multiple biochemical traits in conjunction with hydrophobicity are starting
to be able to understand if a TMH has a functional role beyond anchoring [23, 38],
and the protein trafficking signals held within some TMHs [39].
Despite the advances in availabilty of TMP structures over the last decade, most
are obtained from membrane free environments via X-ray diffraction of crystals, single-molecule cryo-EM and NMR. The relationship between the membrane and TMPs is
underpinned by complex thermodynamic and electrostatic equilibrium. Once inserted
the protein doesn’t leave the membrane as a result of the TMH being very hydrophobic.
This hydrophobicity of TMHs and the hydrophobicity of the lipid tails means that

1.2. BIOLOGICAL MEMBRANES

23

they self-associate and this association is entropically driven by water. Another way of
describing it is that they fiercely dissociate from the water. The overall ∆G for a TMH
in the membrane is -12kcalmol−1 [19]; the association of the helix in the membrane
is typically spontaneous but complex owing to interactions with other TMHs in the
membrane as well as TMP-lipid interactions. Although sometimes there are bound
lipids and detergents included in the crystal lattice, or the TMPs are integrated in
a micelle or bicelle environment this is often insufficient to account for the complex
lipodynamics of the membrane-TMH interactions [40, 41].
There have been several approaches used to attempt to find a more biologically relevant structure contextualised in the membrane (Figure 1.2). OPM [44] and PDBTM
[45] use simplified models of the membrane’s hydrophobic environment to orientate
the TMP into position. MemProtMD [41] uses explicit lipids, a phosphatidylcholine
bilayer, in a flexible Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation along with TMPs accessed
from the PDB [43]. These approaches allow us to enhance our understanding of the
TMP structures in the context of the membrane environment.

1.2.1

Biological membranes
Membrane lipids

The compartmentalisation of cellular biochemistry is arguably one of the most significant events to have occurred in evolution and is certainly one of the fundamental
prerequisites for life [47]. The proteins that allow life to use this biochemical barrier
are perhaps equally important. Together, the lipid bilayer and proteins therein allow
complex biochemical systems that facilitate life as we know it.
It is critical to understand that the lipid bilayer and the transmembrane α helices are inextricably linked, and often what we observe from the α helices reflect the
properties of the much harder to study membranes. For example, often TMHs reflect
the membrane environments they exist in, for example the hydrophobicity, asymetry,
and thickness of the membrane lipids is reflected when looking at large numbers of
TMPs [48].
The lipid membranes influence the local structure, dynamics, and activity of proteins in the membrane in non-trivial ways [49–56], as well as protein folding [57].

The lipids that make up these membranes are very diverse, and not only do different
cells have different membrane compositions, but so do different subcellular compartments which again is reflected in the TMH composition of TMPs [48, 58].
They consist of a polar head group and a hydrophobic region and so are described
as being amphiphilic molecules. This factor, along with geometric contraints of the

1.2. BIOLOGICAL MEMBRANES

25

membrane lipids causes them to not only be insoluble molecules, but also that they
readily self-associate into complex ordered structures that has been demonstrated in
silico with coarse grain MD simulations [59]. This self association is entropically
driven by water molecules. There is a rich variety of lipid molecules that make up
the biological membranes. In other words, the bilayer forms from these phospholipid
molecules due to the fierce dissociation between the polar water and the hydrophobic
tails. Furthermore, the bilayer maximises van der Waals interactions between the
closely-packed hydrocarbon chains, which contributes to the stability of the bilayer.
This can be seen even in relatively early MD simulations [60].
The majority of lipids in higher organism membranes are phospholipids, sphingolipids, and sterols. The hydrophobicity of a membrane lipid can be caused by
several features; (i) aliphatic chains such as in the most abundant membrane lipids,
glycerophospholipids and the sphingolipids, (ii) aromatic groups, or (iii) polycyclic
structures such as the sterols most abundantly of which in mammals is cholesterol
[61, 62]. Phospholipids are composed of a glycerol molecule. Bonded to the glycerol
molecule are two hydrophobic fatty acid tail groups and a negatively-charged polar
phosphate group. The polar phosphate group is modified with an alcohol group.
It has been known for some time that biological bi-layer membranes are asymmetric [26, 63]. For example, in the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, the
outer membrane leaflet contain lipopolysaccharide, whilst the inner is a mixture of
approximately 25 phospholipid types [58]. Adding to the membrane asymmetry composition story, a thorough analysis of residue composition in yeast and human TMH
regions revealed intra-membrane leaflet composition asymmetry in the Endoplasmic
Reticulum (ER), but not the Golgi [48]. Furthermore, protein-lipid interactions have
been shown to be determinants of membrane curvature [55], and undertake complex
orientations and conformations to allow for hydrophobic mismatch [64].
The evolutionary theories behind these various membrane compositions emerging
is complex and remains in dispute. A popular theory is that eukaryotic cells used
mitochondria as the ATP synthesisers to provide an energetic boost, the result of which
was a massive shift in the evolution of novel eukaryotic protein folds, membrane bound
organelle structures, sexual reproduction, and complex inter-cellular cooperation in
the form of multi-cellular organisms [65, 66]. A lot of this theory rested on the idea

26

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

that mitochondrial membranes within the eukaryotic cells were energetically favorable,
however more recent experimentation disputes this claim [67].

1.2.2

Membrane potential

Simply put, membrane potential is the voltage across a membrane. If the membrane
is permeable to a certain type of ion, then the ion will experience an electrical pulling
force during the diffusion process that pulls toward the “preferred” biological location.
This clearly depends on a chemical component involving both the charge and ion
concentration gradient. There are various ways of estimating the membrane potential
ab initio.
The Nernst equation can be derived directly from the simplified thermodynamic
principles (i) the Boltzmann distribution, and (ii) a field charge interaction energy [68].
It is defined as:
RT
cout
× ln
(1.1)
F
cin
Where charge Em is the membrane potential, z is the ion charge, c is the concenEm =

tration of an ion in that cell environment.
However, the Nernst equation is rife with caveats caused by the assumptions of
the simplified model. Such assumptions include ions having point charge, that the
potential is constant throughout the solution. This issue is compounded because it
assumes the constant potential is the same as the point of measurement which can be
heavily influenced by, for example, a specific adsorption of either part of the redox pair
or the competitive adsorption of a supporting ion in solution [68]. Considering that in
biology the compartments always involve multiple ion channels and constant flux of
biochemical environments, one should be cautious to understand the limitations and
variability when extrapolating experimentally determined E0 , particularly when using
such an idealised model in a biological context.
Several studies have attempted to quantify the various voltages across the intracellular membranes. Negativity was found in the ER, with a voltage between 75mV
to 95mV in the ER membrane [69, 70]. Negativity was found in the mitochondrial
matrix with a voltage across the mitochondrial membrane at 150mV [71]. No notable
membrane potential has been identified in the Golgi [72, 73].

1.3.1

Transmembrane helix sequence composition

Measurements of the TMH regions have found that they are roughly 20 residues in
length; 17.3±3.1 from 160 TMHs [74], 27.1±5.4 residues based on 129 TMHs [75], 26.4
residues based on 45 TMHs [76], 25.3±6.0 residues based on 702 TMHs [77], 24.6±5.6
from 837 TMHs [78], and 28.6±1.6Å to 33.5 ±3.1Å from 191 proteins depending on
membrane types [79]. There are a couple of reasons for this variation. Primarily is
that the boundaries of TMHs are extremely hard to precisely identify since it is unclear
exactly how far the TMH rises into the water interface region [17]. Secondly is that it
is emerging that different membranes have different thicknesses [58], and that this is
directly reflected in the hydrophobic lengths of the TMH [48, 79].
From left to right: a typical and traditional TMH, an exceptionally long TMH, a
TMH that lies flat in the interface region, a kinked helix that enters and exits the bilayer on the same leaflet, a TMH that is not long enough to span the entire membrane.
These exceptional formations present a challenge for topology predictions of the loop
regions.
The language used to describe TMHs varies somewhat across the literature, primarily due to a changing understanding of TMH general structure and relevance to
function over the last 15 years or so. There is a general composition of a TMH despite
specific protein and membrane constraints [48].
A study by Baeza–Delgado et al. from 2013 [78] looked at TMHs in 170 integral
membrane proteins from a manually maintained database of experimentally confirmed
TMPs; MPTopo [81]. The group examined the distribution of residues along the
TMHs. As expected, half of the natural amino acids are equally distributed along
transmembrane (TM) helices whereas aromatic, polar, and charged amino acids along
with proline are biasedly near the flanks of the TM helices [78]. It has been noted that
transitions between the polar and non-polar groups at the ends of the hydrophobic core
occur in a more defined edge on the cytoplasmic side than at the extracytoplasmic face
when counting from the middle of the helix outwards [78]. This is probably reflecting

charged groups, it is by no means absolute laws and many proteins break these “rules” [48, 78, 79].

the different lipid composition of both leaflets of biological membranes [78].

A previous study by Sharpe et al. from 2010 used 1192 human and 1119 yeast
predicted TMHs that were not structurally validated to further explore the difference
in TMH and leaflet structure by exploiting the evolutionary conserved sequence differences between the TMH in the inner and outer leaflets [48]. TMHs from vertebrates
and invertebrates were found to be reasonably similar compositionally. The differences in consensus TMH structure implies that there are general differences between
the membranes of the Golgi and ER. The abundance of serines in the region following
the lumenal end of Golgi TMSs probably reflects the fact that this part of many Golgi
enzymes forms a flexible linker that tethers the catalytic domain to the membrane [48].

1.3. α HELICES IN THE MEMBRANE; STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

29

The “positive-inside” rule
Two publications by von Heijne coined the “Positive-Inside” rule demonstrated the
practical value of positively charged residue sequence clustering in topology prediction
of TMHs in bacteria [82, 83]. It was clearly defined and shown that positively charged
residues more commonly were found on the “inside” of the cytoplasm rather than the
periplasm of E. coli. More recently still large-scale sequence analysis of TMHs from
different organelle membrane surfaces in eukaryotic proteomes, show the clustering of
positive charge being cytosolic [48, 78, 79].
The aromatic belt
Tyrosine and tryptophan residues commonly are found at the interface boundaries
of the TMH and this feature is called the “aromatic belt” [48, 78, 84–86]. Not all
aromatic residues are not found in the aromatic belt; phenylalanine has no particular
preference for this region [85, 87]. However, it still remains unclear if this is to do with
anchoring or translocon recognition [78].
A study of conserved tryptophan residues during folding of integrin αIIβ3 TM
complex demonstrated the anchoring effects of tryptophan (0.4 kcal/mol contribution to membrane stability) in TMHs is greater than the other residues [88]. It was
suggested that it’s wide amphiphilic range (it’s stabilising energetic contribution in
either hydrophobic or polar sites) complements the heterogeneity and asymmetry of
mammalian membrane lipids in particular.
The Tyrosine side chain is a six-membered aromatic ring with an OH group attached. Tryptophan has two aromatic rings that are fused into one large hydrophobic
ring-structure. Phenylalanine, although aromatic, is completely hydrophobic, and is
found in the transmembrane part rather than the interfacial parts of TMHs. The
classical explanation for the preference of Tyrosine and Tryptophan to reside in the
interfacial regions is their dipolar character. The side chain must simply seek compromise. This can be achieved by burying the aromatic ring close to, or within, the
hydrophobic core, while the hydrophilic part can interact with the polar lipid headgroups at the interface. Other factors such as the aromaticity, size, rigidity and shape
of Tryptophan, rather than its dipolar character, has also been suggested as the primary reasons for its interfacial preference.

30

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

Snorkelling
Broadly speaking, TMHs are non-polar. However, some contain polar and charged
residues in the helix itself. Whilst this might seem thermodynamically unstable at
first glance, a molecular dynamic feature called the “snorkel” effect explains in part
how this is possible [89, 90]. Simply put, the snorkelling effect involves the long flexible
side chain of leucine reaching the water interface region to interact with the polar headgroups of the bilayer even when the α helix backbone is pulled into the hydrophobic
layer [91]. This has also been suggested to allow helices to adapt to varying thicknesses
of the membrane [92]. More recently it was found that although in simulations the
energetic cost of arginine at the centre of the TMH is large, in vivo experimentation
with the Sec61 translocon reveals a much smaller penalty [93]. That same study also
found that in MD simulations, snorkelling, bilayer deformation, and peptide tilting
combined to to be sufficient to lower the thermodynamic stability penalty of arginine
insertion so that hydrophobic TMHs with a central arginine residue will readily insert
into the membrane.

1.3.2

The hydrophobicity of transmembrane segments

Perhaps the most prevalent and important feature of the transmembrane regions is
the membrane spanning region which is composed mostly of non-polar residues. The
importance of hydrophobicity on the effectiveness of membrane anchoring has been
known for some time [94]. More recently the hydrophobic group region has been
associated with cell localisation and a broad range of biochemical functions [23, 48,
95].
Over the last 50 years or so, there have been many attempts to use hydrophobicity scales of residues to predict structural classifications of proteins. Due to the
vast amounts of scales, major efforts have been made to compare them to identify
which ones are better for which tasks of identifying structural elements [96, 97]. Simm
et al. 2016 [96] compared 98 scales and found that the accuracy of a scale for secondary structure prediction depends on the spacing of the hydrophobicity values of
certain amino acids but generally that the methods behind the scales don’t affect the
separation capacity between β sheets or α helices.

1.3. α HELICES IN THE MEMBRANE; STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

31

Throughout this thesis, several scales are used to evaluate and estimate hydrophobic values of peptide chains. All the scales aim for quantifying the hydrophobic values
of each residue. There are several key differences in their methodology, assumptions,
and aims. Ultimately, all the scales are attempting to allow estimation of ∆Gwhf ;
the free energy of a folded helix (f ) from the water (w) into the membrane core (h).
This free energy measurement is regarded as being currently experimentally inaccessible [19].
Although as a trend most of the scales agree, because of the methodological differences, there are indeed variations of values even after normalisation. Due to these
discrepancies, it is preferable and typical amongst the literature to use several scales
to verify the observable trends resulting from interpretation from an individual scale.
Notably, one of the classic scales, Kyte & Doolittle Hydropathy scale shows a striking
similarity to the modern Hessa’s ∆Gaa
app scale, and that generally the “better” scales
count proline as hydrophilic, and focus on helix recognition rather than amino acid
analogues [97]. In α helices from soluble proteins, proline is almost always a helix
breaker, and α helix prediction scales don’t even attempt to quantify a proline scoring penalty, whereas they are highly tolerated in TMHs. Several of the scales used
throughout this thesis are outlined below.

Kyte & Doolittle hydropathy scale
The Kyte & Dootlittle scale [34] is based on the water–vapour transfer free energy
and the interior-exterior distribution of individual amino acids determined previously
[98]. The Kyte & Doolittle gave a composite score to each amino acid based on
evidence from previous experiments in the literature, scaling them between -4.5 and
+4.5. These experiments included the molal volumes of model compounds for the
side-chain R groups [99–101], the water vapour partition coefficients [99, 102], and
water-ethanol transfer free energies [103, 104]. However alanine, tyrosine, leucine, and
proline scores were subjectively modified. The authors found it difficult to accept
that the single methyl group from alanine would have more hydrophobic force than
leucine, which contains 4 methyl groups so the score was arbitrarily lowered to half
way between the originally determined score, and the score of glycine. Tyrosine and
leucine had their hydropathy values raised to one closer to the water vapour transfer

32

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

free energy than experimental data suggested. In the case of proline, no suitable model
existed and it tends to become buried, indicating that it is fairly hydrophilic. However,
because it contains three methyl groups, the score considers it more hydrophobic than
the experiments suggested. The authors stated: “None of these last 3 adjustments,
the result of personal bias and heated discussion between the authors, affects the
hydropathy profiles in any significant way”[34]. Arginine represents the bottom of the
scale, arbitrarily set at -4.5.

polar TMH for an anchor [105], demonstrating the sensitivity of this method. Figure adapted from
Kyte & Doolittle, 1982 [34].

An algorithm called SOAP was used to scan a window of ±10 residues either side
of each residue (allowing for half windows) across a protein to take the mean average
of each position and plot them on a profile (Figure 1.4). Sustained areas of high
hydrophobicity were indicative of a TMH [34].

1.3. α HELICES IN THE MEMBRANE; STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

33

Hessa’s biological hydrophobicity scale
This is arguably the most biologically relevant scale [97], and is often called the ∆Gaa
app
scale. The scale is based on an experimental method where the free energy exchange
during recognition of designed poly-peptide TMH by the ER Sec61 translocon occurred [84]. These measurements were then used to calculate a biological hydrophobicity scale. The original study reported positional variance in some residues and is
strictly valid only for residues in the core of the TMH. A more refined study quantified
the positional dependencies of each amino acid type [35].

White and Wimley octanol – interface whole residue scale
This scale is calculated from two other scales; the octanol scale, and the interface
scale [106]. This scale is fundamentally based on the partitioning of host-guest pentapeptides (acetyl-WL-X-LL-OH) and another set of peptides (AcWLm) between water and octanol, as well as water to Palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC).

The Eisenberg hydrophobic moment consensus scale
The Eisenberg scale is a consensus scale based on the earlier scales from Tanford [104],
Wolfenden [107], Chothia [98], Janin [108], Wolfenden [109], and the von Heijne
scale [110]. The scales are normalised according to serine [111]. The automatic
TRANSMEM annotation currently used in UniProt is according to TMHMM [28],
Memsat [27], Phobius [32] and the hydrophobic moment plot method of Eisenberg
and coworkers [111].

1.3.3

Sequence complexity

Whilst identifying TMH presence in a protein is somewhat trivial with modern tools,
the role it plays within the membrane is hard to determine. Sequence properties that
can be analysed by bioinformatics, the sequence information complexity and hydrophobicity, of the TMH have been used to predict the role of the TMH as either functional
or structural, and as a discrete cluster from other SCOP annotated helices [23]. Those
findings demonstrated that the sequence of the TMH holds valuable information regarding biological roles, and forms the basis of our interest in the link between the

polarity of a helix and functional activity beyond structural anchoring.
TMSOC’s z-score is able to distinguish between functionally active TMHs and
those only associated with anchoring [23, 38]. This was determined with annotation
of TMHs from the UniProt database (303 membrane anchors and 1741 functional TM
helices) from UniProt [36] and tested with 181132 TMH sequences. Two peaks can
be observed when stratifying the hydrophobicity and the sequence complexity of the
TMHs (Figure 1.5). These peaks correspond with the “simple” and “complex” TMH
annotation.

Figure 1.5: The hydrophobic-complexity continuum distinguishes between TMH anchors, and those with function beyond anchoring. A) Two distinct points can be observed
when plotting sequence complexity on the x axis, frequency on the y axis, and hydrophobiciy on the
z axis of TMHs from UniProt. These peaks were shown to correspond to the membrane anchor and
functional TMH populations. From Wong et al., 2011 [38]. B) The α helix hydrophobicity complexity

the membrane anchors, in red are the TMH with function, and in green are non-TM α helicess from
SCOP [112]. Clear distinctions can be made between the 3 groups and in fact a composite z-score of
the distance of these two factors from the functional TMH group allows prediction of which group a
TMH belongs to [23, 38]. From Wong et al., 2012 [23].

The z-score is a product of both hydrophobicity and a Shannon like sequence
entropy [23, 38] of the character string in the TMH. This term is described below in
equation 1.2.

the mean and standard deviation of the sequence entropy and hydrophobicity of the
functional TMH set, that is those TMHs containing active residues.
Sequence entropy, is essentially an estimate of the linguistic entropy of a string. In
the context of biology can be thought of as an estimation of the non-randomness of
a sequence. Sequence complexity can be used to analyse DNA sequences [114–116],
however here we will focus on the analysis of the complexity of a sequence in protein
sequences.
Broadly speaking, the information theory entropy of a linguistic string can be
defined as in equation 1.3.

Where H is the entropy of a sequence (S), and pi is the probability of a character i through each position (n) in S. This allows us to quantify the average relative
information density held within a string of information [117].
The compositional complexity is measured over sequence windows. If we have an
amino acid composition {ni }i = min i, . . . , max i with a window length of L = Σni ,
the total number of sequences can be calculated by dividing a factorial of the length
by the product of the compositions, i.e N = L!/Πni possible sequences. The SEG
algorithm [113, 118] identifies sub-segments of the raw region which have the lowest
probability. The algorithm searches for and concatenates sub-threshold segments for
the Shannon entropy-like term in equation 1.4

The lowest probability sub-segment can be defined as K1 = log N/L. By altering
the window lengths, and the thresholds SEG can be optimised to search for subtle
compositional deviations, such as coil-coiled regions.

Biogenesis of transmembrane proteins
An overview of translocation

In this thesis we focus on co-translation via the Sec pathway, and on post-translational
pathway of TA proteins in eukaryotic systems (Figure 1.6).

Figure 1.6: A simplified schematic of the co-translational Sec pathway and the post-translational pathway. The ribosome translates RNA to a nascent polypeptide chain. In the
case of post-translational insertion (the left-path), the nascent peptide is release, albeit briefly, to
the cytosol. Chaperones of various types then shield the protein TMH and bring it into contact
with various TM bound translocation machinery. In the case of co-translation (the right-path), the
Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) binds to the emerging signal sequence of the nascent peptide,
which slows protein synthesis of the ribosome. SRP then targets the ribosome protein complex to
the Signal Recognition Particle Receptor (SR), which then moves into contact with the translocon.
As the nascent protein is inserted into the translocon, SR and SRP detach from the complex and
translocation begins.

The Sec pathway is conserved across all life [119] and is facillitated by the heterotrimeric SecYEG (prokaryotic) and Sec61 (eukaryotic) translocons. SecYEG targets proteins to the Plasma Membrane (PM) (inner membrane) of bacteria. In bacteria
nearly all TMPs are inserted by either the Sec pathway via SecYEG machinery, or by
the structurally unrelated the 5-fold more abundant YidC machinery [Dalby2014,

1.4. BIOGENESIS OF TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEINS

37

120], and proteins can often use either pathway. Sec61 targets proteins to the ER
of eukaryotic cells. Broadly speaking, these proteins translocate hydrophilic peptides
across a membrane whilst also integrating sufficiently hydrophobic sequences to the
membrane [Rapoport2012, Shao2011, 19, 95]. In bacteria, the SecY protein is
partly encircled by SecE (Sec61γ in eukaryotes) which enhances it’s stability in the
membrane [121]. SecG is made up of two TMHs and a cytosolic loop. It has been
associated with SecA dependent translocation of secretory proteins [122, 123]. SecA
is an ATPase and a membrane channel that can clamp translocating substrates above
the SecY pore [124].
Whilst ultimately the translocon machinery is built of multiple subunits, the TM
translocating protein itself is a 10 TMH protein with an hourglass shaped interior
pore [126] (SecY in prokaryotes or Sec61α in eukaryotes). When translocation is not
occuring and the protein is idle, the hydrophobic core is constricted [95] and a lumenal
plug is in place over the pore resulting in a seal across the TMP pore [127, 128] that
protects the membrane from ion flow [129] (Figure 1.7). SPs in stalled nascent chains
crosslinked to the lipid and to the translocon machinery [130], showing that there may
be a holding space which exposes the TMH to the membrane interfacial environment
before insertion is complete and this was verified by more recent EM structural study
[131, 132].
During translocation the plug exits the pore, the constriction ring is opened, and
a lateral gate opens between TMH2 and TMH3, and TMH7 and TMH8 to integrate
TMHs to the membrane [126, 131, 133–136] (Figure 1.7). Mutation experiments on
these three features (the plug, contriction ring, and lateral gate) destabalised the closed
state of the translocon and resulted in a protein localisation phenotype that suppressed
inactivating mutations in signal sequences [137–140] and even caused transient channel
openings in bacteria [141].
The ER Membrane protein Complex (EMC) can act as a post-translational TA
protein insertase [39]. Furthermore, recently it was shown that the EMC was also able
to act cooperatively with the Sec translocon during cotranslational insertion on a subsert of multipass TMPs in both yeast and human cells [5]. Proximity specific ribosome
profiling in yeast confirmed that the EMC engages the translocating multipass TMPs,
especially those containing charged residues in the TMH. This would explain why it

also interacts with TA proteins TMHs [5, 39]. Pulldown experiments revealed that
the EMC stabilised the synthesised TMPs and recuited chaperones (both substrate

1.4. BIOGENESIS OF TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEINS

specific and general) that allowed unstable TMPs to achieve viable conformations allowing function in the ER and transport to the Golgi. In the absence of the EMC,
UPS (a proteasome) degrades the membrane proteins.
This dual function of the EMC is analogous with YidC [5] in bacteria which has
the role of an insertase [Dalby2014, 120, 142] as well as interacting with SecYEG to
stabilise translocated TMPs [143].

1.4.2

Signal peptides

SPs are short peptide sequences present at the N-terminus of most secretory pathway
destined proteins in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Mutations to the length and
compostion of the SP revealed their composition is essential for effective localised transport, however they have high compositional variability [144]. Like TMHs they translocate into the membrane due to their hydrophobic α helix (albeit typically shorter than
a TMH) and follow the positive-inside rule.

and a c-region of 3-7 residues that invites cleavage by specific signal peptidase (in red). Adapted from
von Heijne, 1990 [145].

Once the protein is fully translocated and at the correct location within the cell, a
three domain signal peptidase cleaves the SP from the rest of the protein. SPs can also
be experimentally interchanged to proteins from different organisms to target them to
cellular locations [146, 147].
SPs are rarely used by TMPs with the exception of most type I TMPs, which are
defined by the presence of an SP. Instead, TMPs use their first TMH and flanking
region as a targetting signal. Many bioinformatic methods over the last twenty years

40

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

have aimed to predict SPs and sort them from TMHs [148], however these methods all
struggle to distinguish SPs from N-terminal TMHs [37]. This is due to the similarities
SPs have with glstmhs, and that although TMHs are not cleaved, the cleavage site
pattern alone cannot effectively separate SPs from TMHs. This results in many false
positives for SP presence in genome wide studies [37]. SignalP 4, a neural network
based approach, is less effective at predicting cleavage sites or SP prediction in the
absence of TMPs from the dataset, however currently is the most accurate method to
distinguish the currently vague differences between TMHs and SPs [37].

1.4.3

β sheets in the membrane

The membrane is critical in maintaining the separation of biochemically distinct compartments. However, there needs to be flux of not only molecules, but information
signals across these membranes in order to facillitate cellular life. Whilst the focus
of this thesis is primarily on TMHs it is important to acknowledge that β sheets are
another secondary structural element capable of spanning the membrane.
β barrel proteins are present only in a few membrane types; the outer membrane of
Gram negative bacteria for which they constitute between 2-3% of the genome [149],
and in the outer membranes of eukaryotic chloroplasts and mitochondrial membranes.
Their restriction to these membrane types is the result of ancestral symbiogenesis
[150–155].
These outer membrane proteins cause the membranes to be permeable, diminishing
membrane potential between the outer and the inner membrane. Unlike the TMHs,
β barrel proteins are permeable to water and many other small molecules often unspecifically due to their large pore (Figure 1.9). Integral β barrel proteins consist of
between 8 and 26 apmphipathic antiparallel β strands forming a cylindrical pore. They
are capable of active and passive transport, molecule receptors, enzymatic catalysis,
structural formation, and translocon machinery [149].
The biogenesis of β barrel membrane proteins also differs from that of TMHs, and
there are differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
In Gram negative bacteria, the β barrel proteins are translated on cytoplasmic ribosomes (Figure 1.10). An N-terminal SP sequence allows the protein to pass through

the inner membrane to the outer membrane [156, 157]. Instead of cotranslational insertion, SecB transports the nascent polypeptide chain to the Sec translocon on the
inner membrane [158]. β-sheets do not trigger the opening of the lateral gate [155].
Once in the periplasm the SP is cleaved [Paetzel2014] and chaperones, such as the
redundant SurA [159, 160], DegQ, and Skp [160], bind to the protein to prevent premature folding. Once at the inner-surface, the BAM complex assembles and integrates
the β barrel protein into the membrane [Hagan2011, 161] via a lateral opening of
one of the BAM subunits, BamA [162].
Unlike in the bacterial outer membrane, β-barrel proteins are rare in the mitochondria [155]. There is Tom40, Tob55, two isoforms of a porin, and Mdm10 [155]. And
yet, indeed it was shown that a β barrel protein fragments not found in the eukaryotic

proteome called trimeric autotransporter can be recognised and assembled byt the mitochondria [163]. Since there is no need to cross the inner membrane, mitochondrial
proteins do not have the cleavable SP, or any other known targetting signal [155]. After cytosolic ribosomes complete the translation, the β barrel proteins are recognised
on the mitochondrial surface by the TOM complex import receptors, handed to the β
barrel protein Tom40 which is the central machinery for mitochondrial protein import
[Chachinska2009]. After being processed through the TOM machinery, hexameric

165].

1.5. THE AIMS OF THIS THESIS.

43

Whereas mitochondria originated from the ancestral incorporation of α-proteobacteria [151], chloroplasts were thought to originate from the incorporation
of cyanobacterium [150]. Similarly to mitochondrial β barrel proteins, there is no
cleavable targetting SP targetting for the chloroplast since they integrate on the internal side of the membrane, however much less is known about the precise insertion
machinery of β barrel proteins at a molecular level in chloroplasts [155].
Besides the differences in biogenesis between β barrel TMPs and TMPs with TMHs
as the membrane spanninging units, there are also biophysical differences. Membrane spanning β sheets exhibit a “positive-outside” distribution of positively charged
residues [79], opposed to the much more typical positive-inside distribution [48, 78,
79, 82, 83]. Typically, β sheets are less hydrophobic than TMHs [166] as a result of
their amphiphilic nature.

1.5

The aims of this thesis.

In this thesis we explore three ideas surrouding the role of TMHs in the membrane.
In chapter 2 we explore the sequence composition of large datasets of TMHs straifying them by species, organelle, single-pass and multi-pass. After considering the rarity
of certain amino acid types, we ellucidate a “negative-outside” tendency in concert with
the positive-inside rule. We go on to further divide the single-pass group into complex
and simple TMHs according to TMSOC. This reveals that simple TMHs have amino
acid distribution features along the helix that would optimise for anchoring, however
complex TMHs are more akin to TMHs from multi-pass TMPs.
In chapter 3 we generate an up to date dataset of post-translationally inserted TA
proteins based on previous methods and compare the TMHs within to a manually
curated TA protein dataset from UniProt. This cross examination revealed TMH
adaptaions to mitochondrial membranes such as a reversal of the “positive-inside”
rule and a reduction in hydrophobicity caused by an abundance of alanine residues in
lieu of leucine rather than an increase of polar residues. We also generate homology
models of two spontanously inserting TMHs from TA proteins and show that they
have an amphiphatic surface which may be key to their insertion.
In chapter 4 we look at families of TMPs that exhibit high hydrophobic discrepency

44

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

between sequentially adjacent TMHs. The conservation of these pairs across the families corroborates evidence of cooperative TMH insertion, showing that marginally
hydrophobic TMHs could use typical TMHs as part of their biogenesis on a larger
scale than previously thought.

Chapter 2
The “Negative-Outside” rule.
The description of a TMH remains incomplete. The understanding of TMP topology is erroneous, and despite a wealth of structures, the general model of helix-helix
and helix-lipid interactions remains speculative and requires a great deal of intensive
analysis to generate a working model of a particular TMP.
The work presented in this chapter is an expanded version of published work [167].
We use advanced statistical analysis to analyse large sequence datasets that have rich
topological annotation. By analysing these sequences in the context of anchorage,
we find that some TMHs are confined to biological constraints of the membrane,
whereas others that likely contain function beyond anchorage, are less conforming to
the membrane. Specifically, there is further elaboration of statistical definitions in the
methods than in the published paper.

Abstract

Summary

As the idea of positive residues inside the cytoplasm emerged during the late 1980s,
so did the idea of negative residues working in concert with TMH orientation. It was
shown that removing a single lysine residue reversed the topology of a model erichia
coli protein, whereas much higher numbers of negatively charged residues are needed
to reverse topology [168]. One would also expect to see a skew in negatively charged
distribution if a cooperation between oppositely charged residues orientated a TMH,
45

46

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE.

however there is no conclusive evidence in the literature for an opposing negatively
charged skew [48, 78, 79, 85, 86]. However, in E. coli negative residues do experience
electrical pulling forces when travelling through the SecYEG translocon indicating
that negative charges are biologically relevant [21]. In this chapter, we explore the
literature surrounding charged residue distribution in the TMH, and demonstrate that
the “negative-outside” skew exists in anchoring TMHs

2.3

Introduction

Two decades ago, the classic concept of a TMH was a rather simple story: Typical TMPs were thought to be anchored in the membrane by membrane-spanning bundles of non-polar α–helices of roughly 20 residues length, with a consistent orientation
of being perpendicular to the membrane surface. Although this is broadly true, hundreds of high quality membrane structures have elucidated that membrane-embedded
helices can adopt a plethora of lengths and orientations within the membrane. They
are capable of just partial spanning of the membrane, spanning using oblique angles,
and even lying flat on the membrane surface [17, 18]. The insertion and formation
of the TMHs follow a complex thermodynamic equilibrium [19, 169, 170]. From the
biological function point of view, many TMHs have multiple roles besides being just
hydrophobic anchors; for example, certain TMHs have been identified as regulators of
protein quality control and trafficking mechanisms [22]. As these additional biological
functions are mirrored in the TMHs sequence patterns, TMHs can be classified as
simple (just hydrophobic anchors) and complex sequence segments [23, 24, 38].
The relationship between sequence patterns in and in the vicinity of TMHs and
their structural and functional properties, as well as their interaction with the lipid
bilayer membrane, has been a field of intensive research in the last three decades [1].
Besides the span of generally hydrophobic residues in the TMH, there are other trends
in the sequence such as with a saddle-like distribution of polar residues (depressed
incidence of charged residues in the TMH itself), an enriched occurrence of positively
charged residues in the cytosolic flanking regions as well as an increased likelihood of
tryptophan and Tyrosine at either flank edge [48, 78, 82, 85, 171, 172]. Such properties
vary somewhat in length and intensity between various biological organelle membranes,

2.3. INTRODUCTION

47

between prokaryotes and eukaryotes [173] and even among eukaryotic species studied
due to slightly different membrane constraints [48, 79]. These biological dispositions
are exploitable in terms of TM region prediction in query protein sequences [174,
175] and tools such as the quite reliable TMHMM [28, 176], Phobius [32, 177] or
DAS-TMfilter represent todays prediction limit of TMHs hydrophobic cores within the
protein sequence [178–180]. The prediction accuracy for true positives and negatives is
reported to be close to 100% and the remaining main cause of false positive prediction
are hydrophobic α–helices completely buried in the hydrophobic core of proteins. To
note, reliable prediction of TMHs and protein topology is a strong restriction for
protein function of even otherwise noncharacterised proteins [181–183] and thus, very
valuable information.
The “positiveinside rule” reported by von Heijne [17, 82] postulates the preferential occurrence of positively charged residues (lysine and arginine) at the cytoplasmic
edge of TMHs. The practical value of positively charged residue sequence clustering
in topology prediction of TMH was first shown for the plasmalemma in bacteria [82,
184]. As a trend, the “positive-inside rule” has since been confirmed with statistical observations for most membrane proteins and biological membrane types [78, 86,
185, 186]. However, more recent evidence suggests that, in thylakoid membranes, the
“positive-inside rule” is less applicable due to the co-occurrence of aspartic acid and
glutamic acid residues together with positively charged residues [79].
The positive-inside rule also received support from protein engineering experiments
that revealed conclusive evidence for positive charges as a topological determinant [82,
168, 187, 188]. Mutational experiments demonstrated that charged residues, when
inserted into the centre of the helix, had a large effect on insertion capabilities of
the TMH via the translocon. Insertion becomes more unfavourable when the charge
was placed closer to the TMH core [84].
It remains unclear exactly why and how exactly the positive charge determines
topology from a biophysical perspective. Positively charged residues are suggested to
be stronger determinants of topology than negatively charged residues due to a dampening of the translocation potential of negatively charged residues. This dampening
factor is the result of protein-lipid interactions with net zero charged phospholipid,
phosphatidylethanolamine and other neutral lipids. This effect favours cytoplasmic

48

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE.

retention of positively charged residues [189].
The recent accumulation of TMP sequences and structures allowed revisiting the
problem of charged residue distribution in TMHs (see also http://blanco.biomol.
uci.edu/mpstruc/). For example, whilst β–sheets contain charged residues in the TM
region, -helices generally do not (38). Large-scale sequence analysis of TMH from
various organelle membrane surfaces in eukaryotic proteomes confirm the clustering
of positive charge having a statistical bias for the cytosolic side of the membrane. At
the same time, there are many TMH exception examples to the positive-inside rule;
however as a trend, topology can be determined by simply looking for the most positive
loop region between helices [48, 78].
When the observation of positively charged residues preferentially localised at the
cytoplasmic edge of TMHs emerged, it was also asked whether negatively charged
residues work in concert with TMH orientation. It was shown that a single additional lysine residue can reverse the topology of a model Escherichia coli protein,
whereas a much higher number of negatively charged residues is needed to achieve the
same [168]; nevertheless, a sufficiently large negative charge can overturn the positiveinside rule [190, 191] and, thus indeed, negative residues are topologically active to a
point. Negatively charged residues were observed in the flanks of TMHs [78], especially
of marginally hydrophobic TM regions [192]. It is known that the negatively charged
acidic residues in TM regions have a non-trivial role in the biological context. In E.
coli, negative residues experience electrical pulling forces when travelling through the
SecYEG translocon indicating that negative charges are biologically relevant during
the electrostatic interactions of insertion [21, 193].
Unfortunately, there is a problem with statistical evidence for preferential negative charge occurrence next to TMH regions. Early investigations indicated overall
both positive and negative charge were influential topology factors, dubbed the charge
balance rule. If true, one would also expect to see a skew in the negative charge distribution if a cooperation between oppositely charged residues orientated a TMH [184,
194]. It might be expected that, if positive residues force the loop or tail to stay inside, negative residues would be drawn outside and topology would be determined not
unlike electrophoresis. Yet, there is plenty of individual protein examples but no conclusive statistical evidence in the current literature for a negatively charged skew [48,

2.3. INTRODUCTION

49

78, 79, 83, 85, 86].
There are many observations described in the literature that charged residues determine topology more predictably in single-pass proteins than in multi-pass TMH [191,
195]. It is thought that the charges only determine the initial orientation of the TMH
in the biological membrane; yet, the ultimate orientation must be determined together
with the totality of subsequent downstream regions [196].
With sequence-based hydrophobicity and volume analysis and consensus sequence
studies, Sharpe et al. [48] demonstrated that there is asymmetry in the intramembranous space of some membranes. Crucially, this asymmetry differs among the membrane
of various organelles. They conclude that there are general differences between the
lipid composition and organisation in membranes of the Golgi and ER. Functional
aspects are also important. For example, the abundance of serines in the region following the lumenal end of Golgi TMHs appears to reflect the fact that this part of
many Golgi enzymes forms a flexible linker that tethers the catalytic domain to the
membrane [48].
A study by Baeza-Delgado et al. [78] analysed the distribution of amino acid
residue types in TMHs in 170 integral membrane proteins from a manually maintained database of experimentally confirmed TMPs (MPTopo [81]) as well as in 930
structures from the PDB. As expected, half of the natural amino acids are equally
distributed along TMH whereas aromatic, polar and charged amino acids along with
proline are biased near the flanks of the TM helices. Unsurprisingly, leucine and
other non-polar residues are far more abundant than the charged residues in the TM
region [48].
In this work, we revisit the issue of statistical evidence for the preferential distribution of negatively charged (and a few other) residues within and nearby TMHs. We
rely on the improved availability of comprehensive and large sequence and structure
datasets for TM proteins. We also show that several methodical aspects have hindered previous studies [48, 78, 79] to see the consistent non-trivial skew for negatively
charged residues disfavouring the cytosolic interfacial region and/or preferring the outside flank. First, we show that acidic residues are especially rare within and in the close
sequence environment of TMHs, even when compared to positively charged lysine and
arginine. Second, therefore, the manner of normalisation is critical: Taken together

50

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE.

with the difficulty to properly align TMHs relative to their boundaries, column-wise
frequency calculations relative to all amino acid types as in previous studies will blur
possible preferential localisations of negative charges in the sequence. However, the
outcome changes when we ask where a negative charge occurs in the sequence relative to the total amount of negative charges in the respective sequence region. Thus,
by accounting for the rarity of acidic residues with sensitive normalisation, the “nonnegative inside rule/negative-outside rule” is clearly supported by the statistical data.
We find that minor changes in the flank definitions such as taking the TMH boundaries
from the database or by generating flanks by centrally aligning TMHs and applying
some standardised TMH length does not have a noticeable influence on the charge
bias detected.

Third, there are significant differences in the distribution of amino acid residues
between single-pass and multi-pass TM regions in both the intra-membrane helix and
the flanking regions with further variations introduced by taxa and by the organelles
along the secretory pathway. Importantly, we find that it is critical to weigh down the
effect of TMHs in multi-pass TMPs with no or super-short flanks to observe statistical
significance for the charge bias. To say it bluntly, if there are no flanks of sufficient
length, there is also no negative charge bias to be observed.

The charge bias effect is even clearer when a classification of TMHs into so-called
simple (which, as a trend, are mostly single-pass and mere anchors) and so-called complex (which typically have functions beyond anchorage) is considered [23, 24, 38]. We
also observe parallel skews with regard to leucine, tyrosine, tryptophan and cysteine
distributions. With these large-scale datasets and a sensitive normalisation approach,
new sequence features are revealed that provide spatial insight into TMH membrane
anchoring, recognition, helix-lipid, and helix-helix interactions.

Acidic residues within and nearby transmembrane helix
segments are rare

In order to reliably compare the amino acid sequence properties of TMHs, we assembled datasets of TMH proteins from what are likely to be the best in terms of quality and comprehensiveness of annotation in eukaryotic and prokaryotic representative
genomes, as well as composite datasets to represent larger taxonomic groups and with
regard to sub-cellular locations (see Table 2.1). In total, 3292 single-pass TMH segments and 29898 multi-pass TMH segments were extracted from various UniProt [36]
text files according to TRANSMEM annotation (download dated 20–03–2016). The
UniProt datasets used only included manually curated records; however, it is still necessary to check for systematic bias due to the prediction methods used by UniProt
for TMH annotation in the majority of cases without direct experimental evidence.
Therefore, a fully experimentally verified dataset was also generated for comparison.
The representative 1544 single-pass and 15563 TMHs were extracted from the manually
curated experimentally verified TOPDB [197] database (download dated 21–03–2016)
referred to as ExpAll here (Table1). TMH organelle residency is defined according
to UniProt annotation. To ensure reliability, organelles were only analysed from a
representative redundancy-reduced protein dataset of the most well-studied genome:
Homo sapiens (referred to as UniHuman herein). The several datasets from UniProt
are subdivided into different human organelles (UniPM, UniER, UniGolgi) and taxonomical groups (UniHuman, UniCress, UniBacilli, UniEcoli, UniArch, UniFungi) as
described in Table 2.1 (see also Methods section). As will be shown below, these various datasets allow us to validate our findings for a variety of conditions, namely with
regard (i) to experimental verification of TMHs, (ii) to origin from various species and
taxonomic groups, (iii) to the number of TMHs in the same protein as well as (iv) to
sub-cellular localisation. Data-sets and programs used in this work can be downloaded
from http://mendel.bii.a-star.edu.sg/SEQUENCES/NNI/.
The hydrophobic nature of the lipid bilayer membrane implies that, generally,
charged residues should be rare within TMHs. For acidic residues, even the location
in the sequence vicinity of TMHs should be disfavoured because of the negatively

data confirms that acidic residues are especially rare in TMHs and their flanking
regions. In Figure 1 where we plot the total abundance of all amino acid types in
single-pass TMHs and multi-pass TMHs (including their ±5 flanking residues), acidic
residues were found to be amongst the rarest amino acids both in UniHuman and

biological scale [84]. Grey represents hydrophilic amino acids that were found to have a positive ∆G

residues and positive residues are coloured in orange. The abundances of key residues are labelled.

The effect is most pronounced in single-pass TMPs (Figure 2.1). There are only
666 glutamates (just 1.24% of all residues) and 560 aspartates (1.05% respectively)
among the total set of 53238 residues comprised in 1705 TMHs and their flanks.
Within just the TMH regions, there are 71 glutamates (0.20% of all residues in TMHs
and flanks) and 58 aspartates (0.16% respectively). This cannot be an artefact of
UniProt TMH assignments since this feature is repeated in ExpAll. There are only

54

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE.

582 glutamates (1.22%) and 520 aspartates (1.09%) among the 47568 residues involved. Within the TMH itself, there are 64 glutamates (0.19%) and 69 aspartates
(0.21%). In both cases, the negatively charged residues represent the ultimate end of
the distribution. To note, acidic residues are rare even compared to positively charged
residues which are about 3–4 times more frequent. On a much smaller dataset of
single-spanning TMP, Nakashima et al. [198] made similar compositional studies. To
compare, they found 0.94% glutamate and 0.94% aspartate within just the TMH region
(values very similar to ours from TMHs with small flanks; apparently, they used more
outwardly defined TMH boundaries) but the content of each glutamate and aspartate
within the extracellular or cytoplasmic domains is larger by an order of magnitude,
between 5.26% and 9.34%. These latter values tend to be even higher than the average
glutamate and aspartate composition throughout the protein database (5–6% [198]).

In the case of multi-pass TMPs (Figure 2.1), glutamates and aspartates are still
very rare in TMHs and their ±5 residue flanks (1.94% and 1.92% from the total of
377207 in the case of UniHuman respectively, 1.79% and 1.70% from the total of
454700 in the case of ExpAll). Yet, their occurrence is similar to those of histidine and
tryptophan and, notably, acidic residues are only about ∼1.5 times less frequent than
positively charged residues. The observation that acidic residues are more suppressed
in single-pass TMHs compared with the case of multi-pass TMHs is statistically significant. In Table 2.1, the acidic residues are counted in the helices (excluding flanking
regions) belonging to either multi-pass or single-pass helices. Indeed, single-pass helices appear to tolerate negative charge to a far lesser extent than multi-pass helices
as the data in the top two rows of Table 2.1 indicates (for datasets UniHuman and
ExpAll). The trend is strictly observed throughout sub-cellular localisations (rows 3–5
in Table 2.1) and taxa (rows 6–10). Statistical significance (P0.001) is found in all but
six cases. These are UniEcoli (D+E, D, E), UniArch (D+E, E) and UniFungi (E).
The problem is, most likely, that the respective datasets are quite small. Notably, the
difference between single- and multi-pass TMHs is greatest in UniPM; here, TMHs
from multi-pass proteins have on average 0.400 negative residues per helix, whereas
single-pass TMHs contained just 0.039 (P=3.86e-28).

Amino acid residue distribution analysis reveals a
“negative-not-inside/negative-outside” signal in singlepass transmembrane helix segments

The rarity of negatively charged residues is a complicating issue when studying their
distribution along the sequence positions of TMHs and their flanks. For UniHuman
and ExpAll , we plotted absolute abundance of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, lysine,
arginine, and leucine at each position (i.e., it scales as the equivalent fraction in the total composition of the alignment column) (Figure 2.2). To note, the known preference
of positively charged residues towards the cytoplasmic side is nevertheless evident. Yet,
it becomes apparent that any bias in the occurrence of the much rarer acidic residues
is overshadowed by fluctuations in the highly abundant residues such as leucine.
The trends become clearer if the occurrence of specific residues is normalised with
the total number of residues of the given amino acid type in the dataset observed in
the sequence region studied as shown for UniHuman and for ExpAll in Figure 2.2. For
comparison, we indicated background residue occurrences (dashed lines calculated as
averages for positions -25 to -30 and 25 to 30). The respective average occurrences in
the inside and outside flanks (calculated from an average of the values at positions -20
to -10 and 10 to 20 respectively) are shown with wide lines.
The “positive-inside rule” becomes even more evident in this normalisation:
Whereas the occurrence of positively charged residues is about the background level
at the outside flank, it is about two to three times higher both for the UniHuman and
the ExpAll datasets at the inside flank. To note, the background level was found to
be 1.7% (lysine) and 1.6% (arginine) in UniHuman and 1.4% (lysine and arginine) in
ExpAll. The inside flank average is 4.3% (lysine) and 4.6% (arginine) in UniHuman
and 4.2% (lysine) and 4.6% (arginine) in ExpAll. The outside flank is similar to the
background noise levels: about 1.4% (lysine) and 1.5% (arginine) in UniHuman and
about 1.5% (lysine) and 1.4% (arginine) in ExpAll.
Most interestingly, a “negativeinside depletion” trend for the negatively charged
residues is apparent from the distribution bias. The inside flank averages for glutamic
acid were 1.1% and 1.4% in UniHuman and ExpAll respectively; for aspartic acid,
1.2% and 1.4% in UniHuman and ExpAll respectively. Meanwhile, the outside flanks

for aspartic acid and glutamic acid occurrences were measured at 2.9% and 2.4%
respectively in UniHuman and, in ExpAll, these values for aspartic acid and glutamic
acid were found to be 2.5% and 2.1% respectively. Against the background level of
aspartic acid (2.8% and 2.9% in UniHuman) and glutamic acid (2.6% and 2.9% in
ExpAll), the inside flank averages were found to be about 2–3 times lower than the
background level while the outside flank averages were comparable to the background
level (Figure 2.2). Taken together, this indicates a clear suppression of negatively
charged residues at the inside flank of single-pass TMHs and a possible trend for
negatively charged residues occurring preferentially at the outside flank. This is not an
effect of the flank definition selection since the trend remains the same when using the
database-defined flanks without the context of the TMH (Figure 2.2). For UniHuman,
the negative charge expectancy on the inside flank doesnt reach above 2% until position
-10 (D) and position -11 (E), whereas, on the outside flank, both D and E start >2%.
The same can be seen in ExpAll where negative residues reach above 2% only as far
from the membrane boundary as at position -9 (D) and position -7 (E) on the inside
but exceed 2% beginning with position 1 (D) and 3 (E) on the outside (Figure 2.2).

The observation of negative charge suppression at the inside flank, herein the
“negative-inside depletion” rule, is statistically significant throughout most datasets
in this study. The inside-outside bias was counted using the Kruskal-Wallis (KW) test
comparing the occurrence of acidic residues within 10 residues of each TMH inside and
outside the TMH (Table 2.2). We studied both the database-reported flanks as well
as those obtained from central alignment of TMHs (see Methods). The null hypothesis (no difference between the two flanks) could be confidently rejected in all cases
(P-value<0.001 except for UniBacilli), the sign of the H-statistic (KW) indicating suppression at the inside and/or preference for the outside flank (except for UniArch).
Most importantly, acidic residues were found to be distributed with bias in ExpAll (Pvalue<3.47e-58) and in UniHuman (P-value=1.13e-93). Whereas with UniBacilli, the
problem is most likely the dataset size, the exception of UniArch, for which we observe
a strong negative inside rule, is more puzzling and indicates biophysical differences of
their plasma-membrane.

Amino acid residue distribution analysis reveals a general negative charge bias signal in outside flank of multipass transmembrane helix segments — the negative
outside enrichment rule

As a result of the rarity of negatively charged residues, any distribution bias is difficult to be recognised in the plot showing the total abundance (or alignment column
composition) of residues in multi-pass TMHs and their flanks from UniHuman and
ExpAll (Figure 2.3). Yet, as with single-pass helices, the dominant general leucine
enrichment, as well as positive inside signal, can be identified with certainty. When
the residue occurrence is normalised by the total occurrence of this residue type in the
sequence regions studied (shown as a relative percentage of at each position for multipass helices from UniHuman and ExpAll in Figure 2.3), the bias in the distribution of
any type of charged residues becomes visible.
With regard to the positive-inside preference, positively charged residues have a
background value of 2.0% for arginine and 2.2% for lysine in UniHuman, and 1.7%
for arginine and 1.9% for lysine in ExpAll. At the inside flank, this rises to 4.6% for
arginine and 4.1% for lysine in UniHuman and 4.6% for arginine and 4.2% for lysine
in ExpAll. The mean net charge at each position was calculated for multi-pass and
single-pass datasets from UniHuman and ExpAll (Figure 2.4). The positive inside rule
clearly becomes visible as the net charge has a positive skew approximately between
residues -10 and -25. What is noteworthy is that the peaks found for single-pass
helices were almost three times greater than those of multi-pass helices. For singlepass TMHs, the peak is +0.30 at position -15 in UniHuman and +0.31 at position
-14 in ExpAll, whereas TMHs from multi-pass proteins had lower peaks of +0.15
at position -13 in UniHuman and +0.10 at position -14 in ExpAll. Thus, there is a
positive charge bias towards the cytoplasmic side; yet, it is much weaker for multi-pass
than for single-pass TMHs.
Notably, a “negative outside enrichment” trend also can be seen from the distribution of the negatively charged residues, though with some effort (Table 3) as the effect
is also weaker than in the case of single-pass TMHs. We studied the flanks under four
conditions: (i) database-defined flanks without overlap between neighbouring TMHs,

Figure 2.4: The net charge across multi-pass and single-pass TMHs shows a stronger
positive inside charge in single-pass TMHs than multi-pass TMHs. The net charge per TMH
plotted at each position; the positive-inside rule is stronger in TMHs from single-pass proteins
than TMHs from multi-pass proteins. The net charge was calculated at each position as described
in the Methods section for the (A) UniHuman and (B) ExpAll datasets. Net charge for TMHs from
multi-pass proteins is shown in black, and the profile of TMHs from single-pass proteins is drawn in
blue.

flanks but allowing overlap of flanks shared among neighbouring TMHs, (iv) same as
condition (ii) but only the subset of cases where there is at least half of the required
flank length at either side of the TMH. In UniHuman as calculated under condition
(i), aspartic acid is lower on the inside flank (2.3%) than on the outside flank (3.0%).
Glutamic acid is also lower at the inside flank (2.4%) than the 2.8% on the outside
flank (Figure 2.3C). Slight variations in defining the membrane boundary point do
not influence the trend (compare figures 2.3C and 2.3E). We find that, in all studied conditions, the UniHuman dataset delivers statistical significances (P-values: (i)
6.10e-34, (ii) 5.43e-41, (iii) 3.00e-57, (iv) 5.60e-41) strongly supporting negative charge
bias (inside suppression/outside preference; see Table 2.3).
Surprisingly, the result could not straightforwardly be repeated with the considerably smaller ExpAll. Under condition (i), we find with ExpAll that aspartic acid has
a background level of 1.0%, an average of 2.6% on the inside flank, and of 2.9% on the
outside flank but glutamic acids background is 1.2% but 2.8% on the inside flank and
2.5% on the outside flank. Statistical tests do not support finding a negative charge
bias in conditions (i) and (ii). Apparently, the problem is TMHs having no or almost
no flanks at one of the sides. Statistical significance for the negative charge bias is
detected as soon as this problem is dealt with either by allowing extension of flanks
overlap among neighbouring TMHs as in condition (iii) or by kicking out examples
without proper flank lengths from the dataset as in condition (iv). The respective
P-values are 2.05e-6 and 9.81e-15 respectively.

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE.

Table 2.3: Statistical significances for negative charge distribution skew on either side
of the membrane in multi-pass TMHs The “Helices” column refers to the total TMHs contained
in each dataset (ExpALL, TMH from TOPDB [197]; UniHuman, human representative proteome;
UniER, human endoplasmic reticulum representative proteome; UniGolgi, human Golgi representative proteome; UniPM, human plasma membrane representative proteome; UniCress, Arabidopsis thaliana (mouse-ear cress) representative proteome, UniFungi, fungal representative proteome;
UniBacilli, Bacilli class representative proteome; UniEcoli, Escherichia coli representative proteome;
UniArch, Archaea representative proteome; see Methods for details). In (A) the “Database-defined
flanks” and in (B) the “Database-defined viable* flanks” and the “Overlapping flanks” columns, the
“Negative residues” column refers to the total number of negative residues found in the ±10 flanking
residues on either side of the TMH and does not include residues found in the TMH itself. (A) In the
“Flanks after central alignment” column, the “Negative residues” column refers to the total number
of negative residues found in the 20 to 10 residues and the +10 to +20 residues from the centrally
aligned residues with a maximum database defined flank length of 20 residues. The total number of
proteins is given in the IDs column. The “Helices” column contains the total number of TMHs in
the dataset (n), the average number of TMHs per protein in that population (µ) and the standard
deviation of that average (σ). The KW scores were calculated for negative residues by comparing
the number of negatively charged residues that were within 10 residues inside and 10 residues outside
the TMH.
*Here, “viable” indicates that in each TMH used for both flanks either side of the TMH has a flank
length of at least half the maximum allowed flank length, in this case 10 (the viable length is 5)

The issues we had with ExpAll raised the question that, maybe, sequence redundancy in the UniHuman set could have played a role. Therefore, we repeated all
calculations but with UniRef50 instead of UniRef90 for mapping into sequence clusters (see Methods section for detail). We were surprised to see that harsher sequence
redundancy requirements do not affect the outcome of the statistical tests in any major way. For the conditions (i)- (iv), we computed the following P-values: (i) 1.31e-28
(5940 negatively residues inside versus 7492 outside), (ii) 1.38e-36 (5516 versus 7320),
(iii) 5.60e-53 (7089 versus 9233) and (iv) 4.18e-41 (4232 versus 5730).
So, the amplifying effect of some subsets in the overall dataset on the statistical
test that might be caused by allowing overlapping flanks (condition (iii)) is not the
major factor leading to the negative charge skew. Similarly, the trend is also not
caused by sequence redundancy. Thus, we have learned that the negative charge bias
does also exist in multi-pass TMPs but under the conditions that there are sufficiently
long loops between TMHs. Bluntly said: no loops equals to no charge bias. As
soon as the loops reach some critical length, there are differences between single-pass
and multi-pass TMHs with regard to occurrence and distribution of negative charges
and the inside-suppression/outside-enrichment negative charge bias appears. Not only
are there more negative charges within the multi-pass TMH itself (in fact, negative
charges are almost not tolerated in single-pass TMHs; see Table 2.1), but also, there is
a much stronger negative outside skew in the TMHs of single-pass proteins than those
of multi-pass proteins.

2.4.4

Further significant sequence differences between singlepass and multi-pass helices: distribution of tryptophan,
tyrosine, proline and cysteine

Amino acid residue profiles along the TM segment and its flanks differ between singleand multi-pass TMHs also in other aspects. The relative percentages of all amino
acid types (normalisation by the total amount of that residue type in the sequence
segment) from single-pass helices of the UniHuman (Figure 2.5A; from 1705 TMHs
with flanks having 68571 residues) and ExpAll (Figure 2.5B; from 1544 TMHs with
flanks having 60200 residues) were plotted as a heat-map. The amino acid types were

listed on the Y axis according to Kyte & Doolittle hydrophobicity [34] in descending
order.

In accordance with expectations, enrichment for hydrophobic residues in the TMH,
for the positively charged residues on the inside flank as well as a distribution the negative distribution bias was found in both datasets. Additionally, the inside interfacial
region showed consistent enrichment hotspots for tryptophan (e.g., 7.1% at position
-11 in ExpAll, 6.2% at position -10 in UniHuman with flanks after central TMH alignment) and tyrosine (6.4% at -11 in ExpAll, 7.1% at -11 in UniHuman), and some
preference can also be seen for the outer interfacial region (e.g., 5.2% at position 11
for tryptophan in ExpAll, and 5.8% at position 10 for tryptophan in UniHuman) albeit the “hot” cluster of the outer flank covers fewer positions than that of the inner
flank. Further, there is an apparent bias of cysteine on the inner flank and interfacial
region (e.g., 5.5% at position -10 in ExpAll, 5.9% at position -11 in UniHuman), and
a depression in the outer interfacial region and flank (up to a minimum of 0.3% in
both ExpAll and UniHuman). Proline appears to have a depression signal on the outer
flank. Note that, in a similar way to Figures 2.2 and 2.3, the distributions of the flanks
derived from centrally aligned TMHs are corroborated by the distributions from the
database defined TMH boundary flanks (see outside bands in Figures 2.5A-D).

A similar heatmap was generated for UniHuman multi-pass (Figure 2.5C; from
12353 TMHs with flanks having 452708 residues) TMHs and ExpAll multi-pass (Figure
2.5D; from 15563 TMHs with flanks having 535599 residues). Whereas Figures 2.5A-C
appear quite noisy, the plot for ExpAll multi-pass TMHs appears almost Gaussian-like
smoothed, thus, indicating the quality of this dataset. Tyrosine and tryptophan in the
multi-pass case do not appear as enriched in the interfacial regions of single-pass TMHs
from both UniHuman and ExpAll. Prolines are only suppressed in the TMH itself and
are not suppressed in the outer flank as in the single-pass case but, indeed, are tolerated
if not slightly enriched in the flanks.

Figure 2.5: Relative percentage heat-maps from predictive and experimental datasets
corroborate residue distribution differences between TMHs from single-pass and multipass proteins. The residue position aligned to the centre of the TMH is on the horizontal axis,
and the residue type is on the vertical axis. Amino acid types are listed in order of decreasing hydrophobicity according to the Kyte and Doolittle scale [52]. The flank lengths in the TMH segments
were restricted to up to ±10 residues. The scales for each heat-map are shown beneath the respective
subfigure. The darkest blue represents 0% distribution, whilst the darkest red represents the maximum relative percentage distribution that is denoted by the keys in each subfigure, with white being
50% between “cold” and “hot”. The central TMH subplots extend from the central TMH residue,
whereas the inner and outer flank subplots use the database-defined TMH boundary and extend from
that position. a TMHs from the single-pass UniHuman dataset. b Single-pass protein TMHs from
the ExpAll dataset. c TMHs from the proteins of the multi-pass UniHuman dataset. d TMHs from
ExpAll multi-pass proteins. The general consistency in relative distributions of every residue type
between single-pass and multi-pass of either dataset including flank/TMH boundary selection allows
us to infer biological conclusions from these distributions that are independent of methodological biases used to gather the sequences. The only residue that displays drastically differently between the
datasets is cysteine in multi-pass TMHs only. The most striking differences in distributions between
residues from TMHs of single-pass and multi-pass proteins include a more defined Y and W clustering
at the flanks, a suppression of E and D on the inside flank, a suppression of P on the inside flank and
a topological bias for C favouring the inside flank.

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE.

2.4.5

Hydrophobicity and leucine distribution in transmembrane helices in single- and multi-pass proteins

Generally, we see in Figure 2.5 that compositional biases appear more extreme in the
single-pass case, particularly when it comes to polar and non-polar residues being more
heavily suppressed and enriched. To investigate this observation, we calculated the
hydrophobicity at each sequence-position averaged over all TMHs considered (after
having window-averaged over 3 residues for each TMH) using the Kyte & Doolittle hydrophobicity scale [34] (Figure 2.6A) and validated using White and Wimley
octanol-interface whole residue scale [106], Hessas biological hydrophobicity scale [84],
and the Eisenberg hydrophobic moment consensus scale [111] (Supplementary Figure 2.7). The total set of TMHs was split into 15 sets of membrane-spanning proteins (1 set containing single-pass proteins, 13 sets each containing TMHs from 2-, 3-,
4-. . . 14-TMPs and another of TMHs from proteins with 15 or more TMHs). In Figure 2.6B, we show the P-value at each sequence position by comparing the respective
values from multi-pass and single-pass TMHs using the 2-sample t-test (Figure 2.6B).
Strikingly, the inside flank of the single-pass TMHs is much more hydrophilic (e.g.,
see the Kyte & Doolittle score=-1.3 at position -18) than that of multi-pass TMHs
(P-value=5.64e-103 at position -14). Most likely, the positive inside rule, along with
the interfacial clustering of tryptophan and tyrosine, contribute to a strong polar inside flank in single-pass helices that is not present in multi-pass helices en masse.
Further, multi-pass TMHs cluster remarkably closely within the TM core; the respective hydrophobicity is apparently not dependent on the number of TMHs in a given
multi-pass TMP. On average, single-pass TMHs are more hydrophobic in the core
than multi-pass TMHs (P-value<1.e-72 within positions -55 and P-value=5.92e-190
at position 0). On the other hand, hydrophobicity differences between TMHs from
single- and multi-pass proteins fade somewhat at the transition towards the flanks
(P-value=1.85e-4 at position -10, and P-value=3.35e-31 at position 10).
Leucine is the most abundant residue in TMHs (Figure 2.1) and is considered one
of the most hydrophobic residues by all hydrophobicity scales. Therefore, it plays a
very influential role in TMH helix-helix and lipid-helix interactions in the membrane
and recognition by the insertion machinery. When looking at the difference in the

Figure 2.6: There is a difference in the hydrophobic profiles of TMHs from single-pass
and multi-pass proteins. a The hydrophobicity of single-pass TMHs compared to multi-pass
segments from the UniHuman dataset. The Kyte and Doolittle scale of hydrophobicity [34] was
used with a window length of 3 to compare TMHs from proteins with different numbers of TMHs.
This scale is based on the water-vapour transfer of free energy and the interior-exterior distribution
of individual amino acids. The same datasets also had different scales applied (Figure 2.7). The
vertical axis is the hydrophobicity score, whilst the horizontal axis is the position of the residue
relative to the centre of the TMH, with negative values extending into the cytoplasm. In black are
the average hydrophobicity values of TMHs belonging to single-pass TMHs, whilst in other colours
are the average hydrophobicity values of TMHs belonging to multi-pass proteins containing the same
numbers of TMHs per protein. In purple are the TMHs from proteins with more than 15 TMHs per
protein that do not share a typical multi-pass profile, perhaps due to their exceptional nature. b The
Kruskal-Wallis test (H statistic) was used to compare single-pass windowed hydrophobicity values
with the average windowed hydrophobicity value of every TMH from multi-pass proteins at the same
position. The vertical axis is the logarithmic scale of the resultant P values. We can much more
readily reject the hypothesis that hydrophobicity is the same between TMHs from single-pass and
multi-pass proteins in the core of the helix and the flanks than the interfacial regions, particularly at
the inner leaflet due to leucine asymmetry ( Table 2.4)

Figure 2.7: There is a difference in the hydrophobic profiles of TMHs from single-pass
and multi-pass proteins. The difference in hydrophobicity between the single-pass and multipass datasets stratified by number of TMHs is not due to the choice of scale. As with Figure 2.6,
UniHuman was stratified according to the number of TMHs in each protein. The mean amino acid
hydrophobicity values of TMHs with a sliding unweighted window of 3 residues from UniHuman
proteins at each position were plotted. To validate the findings presented in Figure 2.6A, several
scales of hydrophobicity were used. (A) The White and Wimley whole residue scale [106] is based
on the partitioning of peptides between water and octanol as well as water to POPC. A positive
score indicates a more polar score. (B) The Hessa biological scale [84]. The hydrophobicity values
represent the free energy exchange during recognition of designed peptide TMHs by the endoplasmic
reticulum Sec61 translocon and, therefore, negative values indicate an energetic preference for the
interior of a lipid bilayer. (C) The Eisenberg consensus scale [111] is a scale based on the earlier scales
from Nozaki and Tanford [104], Wolfenden et al. [109], Chothia [98], Janin [108] and the von Heijne
and Blomberg scale [110]. The scales are normalised according to serine. A positive score indicates
a generally more hydrophobic score.

This trend is statistically significant for TMHs in many biological membranes (Table 2.4, Figure 2.8). In the most extreme case of UniCress (single-pass), we see 49%
more leucine residues on the inside leaflet than the outside leaflet (P-value=5.41e-24).
This contrasts with UniCress (multi-pass), in which the skew is far weaker, albeit yet
statistically significant. There are 6% more leucine residues at the inside half (Pvalue=2.08e-4). The trend of having more leucine residues at the cytoplasmic half of
the TMH is observed for all datasets (both single- and multi-pass) except for UniArch
(single-pass). The phenomenon is statistically significant with P-value<1.e-3 for ExpAll, UniHuman, UniPM and UniCress (both single- and multi-pass). As with negative
charge distribution, UniArch presents a reversed effect compared to other single-pass
protein datasets with a 57% reduction in leucine on the inside leaflet compared to the
outside leaflet (P-value=7.25e-6). However, leucine of TMHs from UniArch multi-pass
proteins have no discernible preference for the inside leaflets (4% more on the inside
leaflet, P-value=0.625).

statistical results when comparing the number of leucine residues from the inner and outer leaflets
in each protein in the dataset. The number of helices per dataset can be found in Table 2.1. The
Kruskal-Wallis test scores (H statistics) were calculated for leucine residues by comparing the number
of leucine residues that were in the inner half of the leaflet with those in the outer half of the leaflet

Figure 2.8: Comparing charged amino acid distributions in TMHs of multi-pass and
single-pass proteins across different species and organelles. The relative percentage distribution of charged residues and leucine was calculated at each position in the TMH with flank lengths
of ±20 in different datasets. The distributions are normalised according to relative percentage distribution. Aspartic acid and glutamic acid are shown in dark purple and light purple respectively.
Leucine, the most abundant non-polar residue in TMHs, is in blue. Arginine and lysine are shown
in orange. TMHs from single-pass proteins are on the left and TMHs from multi-pass proteins are
on the right for different taxonomic datasets: a UniCress, b UniFungi, c UniEcoli, d UniBacilli, e
UniArch, and different organelles: f UniER, g UniGolgi, h UniPM. As a trend, the negative-outside
skew is more present in TMHs from single-pass proteins than multi-pass proteins (Tables 2 and 3).
Another key observation is that in single-pass TMHs there is a propensity for leucine on the inner
over the outer leaflet (Table 2.4)

A negative-outside (or negative-non-inside) signal is
present across many membrane types

regard to membranes at various subcellular localisations. Acidic residues for TMHs
from single-pass and multi-pass helices were plotted according to their relative percentage distributions (of the total amount of this residue type in the respective segment) for
five taxon-specific datasets UniCress (Figure 2.8A), UniFungi (Figure 2.8B), UniEcoli
(Figure 2.8C), UniBacilli (Figure 2.8D), UniArch (Figure 2.8E) and for three organellespecific datasets UniER (Figure 2.8F), UniGolgi (Figure 2.8G), UniPM (Figure 2.8H).
For single-pass proteins in all taxon-specific datasets (with the exception of
UniArch), there are more negative residues at the outside than at the inside. The
skew is statistically significant (see Table 2.2, P<0.001) except for UniBacilli. Despite
statistical significance found for UniFungi (P-value=1.12e-7 for database-defined and
P-value=6.79e-10 for flanks after central alignment; Table 2.2), however, the trend is
not very strong in this case (Figure 2.8B). Whereas the skew is just a suppression of
negatively charged residues at the inside flank for ExpAll and UniHuman (as well as
in UniCress), the bias observed for UniEcoli involves also a negative charge enrichment at the outside flank. In the case of UniArch (Figure 2.8E), we see a negative
inside preference that is 6.0% in the case of aspartic acid, and 6.3% for glutamic acid
(not shown), with much lower values close to 0% on the outside. Whilst the difference is statistically significant for both TMHs (Table 2.2) from single-pass proteins
(P-value=1.83e-12 and P-value=1.43e-11 for two versions of flank determination) and
multi-pass proteins (P-values 4.72e-3, 7.81e-3, 1.28e-4 for three versions of flank determination, see Tables 3A and 3B), the distribution along the position axis is heavily
fluctuating, maybe as a result of the small size of the dataset. However, one can assuredly assign a “negative-inside” tendency to the flanking regions of Archaean TMHs.
In the human organelle datasets, we see trend shifts at different stages in the
secretory pathway. In UniER, there is an enrichment of negative charge on the outside
flank of 1–1.5% that is comparable to the magnitude of the positive inside signal. In
UniGolgi, there is a suppression of negatively charged residues on the inside flank as
well as an enrichment on the inside flank resulting in ∼2% distribution difference. For
UniPM, there is a negative-inside suppression (but no outside enrichment) as well as
a positive-inside signal. All observed trends are statistically significant (see Table 2.2,
P<1.e-5).
For multi-pass TMH proteins, we see either the same trends but in a weaker form

2.4. RESULTS

71

or no skews are observed at all as inspection of the graphs in Figure 2.8 shows. For
datasets UniER, UniGolgi, UniCress, UniFungi, and UniBacilli, the hypothesis of equal
distribution of negatively charged residues cannot be rejected (P-value>0.001, see Table 3); thus, a skew is statistically non-significant. Although UniPM has a statistically
significant bias (P-value<4.30e-12, Table 3), the trends are more subtle and most
present for aspartic acid of UniPM. We see many more negative and positive charges
tolerated within the multi-pass TMHs themselves throughout all datasets (Table 2.1).
To note, there is a positive-inside rule for all multi-pass datasets studied herein.
To conclude, we find that negative-charge bias distribution is a feature of singlepass protein TMHs that is present across many membrane types and it can have the
form of a negative charge suppression at the inside flank or an enrichment of those
charges at the outside flank.

2.4.7

Amino acid compositional skews in relation to transmembrane helix complexity and anchorage function

In previous work, we studied the relationship of TMH composition, sequence complexity and function [23, 24, 38] and concluded that simple TMHs are more probably
responsible for simple membrane anchorage, whereas complex TMHs have a biological
function beyond just anchorage. We wished to see how the skews observed in this
work relate to that classification. Therefore, the single-pass TMHs from UniHuman
and ExpAll were separated into subsets of simple, twilight, and complex TMHs using
TMSOC [23, 38]. The relative percentages of eight residue types (L, D, E, R, K, Y,
W, C; normalisation with the total amount of residues of that amino acid type in
all sequence segments considered) were plotted along the sequence position for simple
and complex helices (Figure 2.9). Of UniHuman single-pass proteins, there were 889
records with simple TMHs and 570 with complex TMHs (Figure 2.9B). In ExpAll,
769 TMHs from single-pass proteins were simple TMHs and 570 were complex TMHs.
It is visually apparent (Figure 2.9) that there are (i) stronger skews and more
inside-outside disparities in simple single-pass TMs than in complex single-pass TMs
and (ii) greater similarities between single-pass complex TM regions and those from
multi-pass proteins compared with simple single-pass TMs in comparison with either

Figure 2.9: Comparing the amino acid relative percentage distributions of simple and
complex TMHs from single-pass proteins and TMHs from multi-pass proteins. Comparing the amino acid relative percentage distributions of simple and complex TMHs from single-pass
proteins and TMHs from multi-pass proteins. TMSOC was used to calculate which single-pass TMHs
were complex and which were simple from ExpAll and UniHuman datasets. Simple TMHs are typically anchors without necessarily having other functions (Wong et al. [24]). The relative percentages
from single-pass simple (shown in light blue), single-pass complex (red), and multi-pass protein TMHs
(black) were plotted for (a, c, e, g, i and k) UniHuman and (b, d, f, h, j and l) ExpAll for (a and
b) positive residues, (c and d) negative residues, (e and f) tyrosine, (g and h) tryptophan, (i and j)
leucine and (k and l) cysteine. The slopes are statistically compared in Tables 5 and 6, and as a
trend, the profiles of complex TMHs are more similar to multi-pass TMH profiles than simple TMHs
are to multi-pass TMHs

of the other two distributions. To examine the statistical significance of these observations, we compared the amino acid distributions (K, R, K+R, D, E, D+E, Y, W, L,
C) across the range of TMHs with flank lengths ±10 residues using the KolmogorovSmirnov (KS), KW and the χ2 statistical tests. To note, the KS test scrutinises for
significant maximal absolute differences between distribution curves; the glskw test is
after skews between distributions and the χ2 statistical test checks the average difference between distributions. Calculations were carried out over single-pass complex,
single-pass simple and multi-pass TMH datasets from both ExpAll and UniHuman (for
P-values and Bahadur slopes, Table 2.5 (dataset UniHuman) and Table 2.6 (dataset
ExpAll)).
Many low P-values in Tables 2.5 and 2.6 indicate significant differences between
the three distributions studied. For the UniHuman dataset (Table 2.5), we find most
striking, significant differences between charged residue distributions (R, K, D, E) of
simple and complex single-pass TMH+flank regions (χ2 P-value<2.23e-3 for single
amino acid types). Similarly, simple single-pass TMH+flank segments differ significantly from multi-pass TMH+flank segments (KW test P-values<3.e-2 for R, K, D,
E, Y, W amino acid types as well as for K+R and D+E). The trends are the same for
the ExpAll dataset (Table 2.6): simple and complex single-pass TMH+flank regions
differ in charged amino acid type distributions (χ2 P-value<4.21e-3 for all cases), as
well as simple single-pass and multi-pass ones, do (KW test P-values<5.e-2 for R, D,
E, Y, W amino acid types and D+E).
Whereas P-value tests for significant differences between distributions depend
strongly on the amount of data, the more informative Bahadur slopes that measure
the distance from the zero hypothesis are independent of the amount of data [199–
201]. As we can see in Tables 2.5 and 2.6, the absolute Bahadur slopes for the simple single-pass to multi-pass comparison are always larger (even by at least an order
of magnitude): (ii) for all three statistical tests applied (χ2 , KS and KW), (ii) for
all amino acid types, for K+R and E+D and (iii) for both datasets UniHuman and
ExpAll. Thus, complex single-pass TMH+flanks have compositional properties that
are indeed very similar to those of multi-pass ones (which are known to have a large
fraction of complex TMHs [23, 38]). This strong evidence implies that the actual issue is not so much about single- and multi-pass TMH segments but between simple

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE.

and complex TMHs where the first are exclusively guided by the anchor requirements
whereas the latter have more complex restraints to fulfil.
Several distribution features of simple TMHs from single-pass proteins when compared to complex TMHs from single-pass proteins and TMHs from multi-pass proteins
that contribute to the statistical differences (Figure 2.9) are especially notable. There
is a more pronounced trend for positively charged residues and tyrosine to be preferentially located on the inside flanks and for negatively charged residues to be on
the outside flanks. The symmetrical peaks in the percentage distribution of tyrosine
in complex single-pass TMHs are more akin to multi-pass TMHs, whereas in simple TMHs the distribution resembles a more typical single-pass helix (compare with
Figure 2.2). Furthermore, the depression of charged residues within the TMH itself is
strongest in simple single-pass TMHs.
To emphasise, tryptophan is essentially not tolerated within the simple TMHs and
there are higher peaks of tryptophan occurrence at either flank. We also see a strong
inside skew for leucine clustering within the core of simple TMHs which is not present
in the “flatter” distributions of complex single-pass TMHs and TMHs from multi-pass
proteins.
There is obviously a cysteine-inside preference for simple, single-pass TMHs but
less in complex, multi-pass TMHs (Figure 2.9). This conclusion is contrary to a
previous study [198] but that deduction was drawn from a much smaller dataset of 45
single-pass TMHs and 24 multi-pass TMPs.

2.5

Discussion

The “negative-outside/non-negative inside” skew in TMHs and their flanks is statistically significant We have seen that, consistently throughout the datasets, there is
a trend for generally rare negatively charged residues to prefer the outside flank of
a TMH rather than the inside (and to almost completely avoid the TMH itself); be
it by suppression on the inside and/or enrichment on the outside. The trend is much
stronger in single-pass protein datasets than in multi-pass protein datasets. However
as we elaborated on further, the real crux of the bias appears to be associated with
the TMH being simple or complex [23, 38], thus, whether or not the TMH has a role

2.5. DISCUSSION

77

beyond anchorage. The existence of this bias has implications for topology prediction
of proteins with TMHs, engineering membrane proteins as well as for models of protein
transport via membranes and protein-membrane stability considerations.
It should be noted that the controversy in the scientific community about the existence of a negative charge bias at TMHs was mainly with regard to multi-pass TMPs.
Despite having access to much larger, better annotated sequence datasets and many
more 3D structures than our predecessors, we also had our share of difficulties here (see
Results section III and Table 3). The straightforward approach results in inconclusive
statistical tests if datasets become small (for example, if selections are restricted to subcellular localisations, 3D structures or if very harsh sequence redundancy criteria are
applied) and, especially, if TMHs with very short or no flanks are included. Therefore
in the case of multi-pass proteins, we studied flanks as taken from the TM boundaries
in the databases under several conditions: (i) without allowing flank overlap between
neighbouring TMHs, (ii) as subset of (i) but with requiring some minimal flank length
at either side, (iii) with overlapping flanks. We also studied flanks after central alignment of TMHs and assuming standardised TMH length. Multi-pass TMHs (without
overlapping flanks) do not show statistically significant negative charge bias under
condition (i) but, apparently, due to many TMHs without any or super-short flanks
at least at one side. Significance appears as soon as subsets of TMHs with flanks at
both sides are studied. Not surprisingly, there is no charge bias if there are no flanks
in the first place. It is perhaps worth noting that the results from multi-pass TMHs
with overlapping flanks may involve amplification of skews since it involves multiple
counting of the same residues. Given the redundancy threshold of UniRef90, we cannot rule out that these statistical skews are the result of a trend from only a small
sub-group of TMPs which is being amplified. Hence, we also needed to observe if these
same observed biases were true in condition (ii), which is indeed the case.
As the “negative-outside/negative-not-inside” skew is widely observed among varying taxa and subcellular localisations with statistical significance, it appears to, at
least to a certain extent, be caused by physical reasons and be associated with
the background membrane potential.

Several earlier considerations and observa-

tion support this thought: (i) Firstly, a concert between the negative and positive

78

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE.

charge on the TMH flanks drives anchorage and the direction of insertion of engineered TMHs [184, 194]. (ii) The inner leaflet of the plasmalemma tends to be more
negatively charged [202]. Specifically, phosphatidylserine was found to distribute in
the cytosolic leaflets of the plasma membrane and it was found to electrostatically interact with moderately positive-charged proteins enough to redirect the proteins into
the endocytic pathway [203]. The negative charge of proteins at the inside of the
plasma-membrane would decrease the anchoring potency of the TMH via electrostatic
repulsion. (iii) Thirdly in membranes that maintain a membrane potential, there are
inevitably electrical forces acting on charged residues during chain translocation as
this influences the translocon machinery when orienting the TMH. Therefore, it is no
surprise that we see an inside-outside bias for negatively charged residues that is opposite to the one for positively charged residues. The negative charges in TMH residues
have been shown to experience an electrical pulling force as they pass through the
bacterial SecYEG translocon import [21, 193]. Also, they are known to be involved in
intra-membrane helix-helix interactions [204]. For example, aspartic acid and glutamic
acid can drive efficient di- or trimerisation of TMHs in lipid bilayers and, furthermore,
that aspartic acid interactions with neighbouring TMHs can directly increase insertion
efficiency of marginally hydrophobic TMHs via the Sec61 translocon [204]. In support
of this, less acidic residues are found in single-pass TMHs, among which only some
will undergo intra-membrane helix-helix interactions. As the mutation studies have
shown negative charge as a topological determinant [168], therefore, it is perhaps no
surprise that we observe a skew in negatively charged residues in a similar manner to
the skew in positively charged residues.

Whereas the “negative-outside/negative-not-inside” skew is observed for distantly
related eukaryotic species and it is also present in Gram-negative bacteria such as
E. coli, this sequence pattern was not observed for the Gram-positive bacteria in
which there is no observable bias. In contrast, Archaea have a statistically significant
“negative-inside” propensity both for single- and multi-pass TMPs. It is known that
Archaea have remarkably different membranes compared to other kingdoms of life due
to their extremophile adaptations to stress [205]. Whilst it is unclear why negative
charge is distributed so differently in UniArch to the other taxonomic datasets, one

2.5. DISCUSSION

79

must appreciate that a much more nuanced approach would be needed to draw formal conclusions about Archaea, which current databases cannot provide due to the
relatively limited information and annotation of Archaean proteomes.
Methodological issues made previous studies struggle to identify negatively charged
skews with statistical significance
Whereas the influence of a negative charge bias in engineered proteins with TM
regions on the direction of insertion into the membrane was solidly established [83, 168,
190, 191, 206], the search for the negative charge distribution pattern in the statistics
of sequences of TM proteins from databases failed to find significance for the expected
negative charge skew [48, 78, 79, 83, 85, 86].
Generally speaking, the datasets from previous studies have been considerably
smaller compared with those in our work (only Sharpe et al. had a similar order of
magnitude [48]), especially those with experimental information about 3D structure
and membrane topology that we used for validation. And they might not have had
the luxury of using UniProts improved TRANSMEM consensus annotation based on
a multitude of TM prediction methods and experimental data, but this is also not
the major issue. We found that there are other factors that are critical for observing
sequence bias such as negative charge skew in the case of TMHs.

i Acidic residues are rare near and within TMH and biases in their distribution
are easily blurred by minor fluctuations of much more frequent amino acid types,
most notably leucine. Therefore, the method of normalisation is critical. We have
shown that normalising by the total amount of residues of the amino acid type
studied within the sequence region under consideration is appropriate to answer
the question where to find a negatively charged residue if there is any at all (called
“relative percentage” in this work).

ii The alignment of the TMHs is critical. It was common practice to align TMH
according to the most cytosolic residue [48] although it is known that the membrane/cytosol boundary of the TMH is not well defined (and the exact boundary is
even less well understood at the non-cytosolic side). Aligning the TM regions and
their flanks from the center of the TMH was first proposed by Baeza-Delgado et

80

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE.
al. [78]. Since we know now that acidic residues are often suppressed in the cytosolic flank and within the TMH, this implies that the few acidic residues found in the
cytosolic interface would appear more comparable to those in the poorly defined
non-cytosolic interface as the respective residues are spread over more potential
positions, diminishing any observable bias.

iii We find that separation into single- and multi-pass TM datasets (or, even better,
simple and complex TMHs [23, 38]) is critical to study the inside/outside bias. As
many TMHs in multi-pass TMPs have essentially no flanks or very short flanks if
the condition of non-overlap is applied to flanks of neighbouring TMHs, this might
also obscure the observation of the negative charge bias. If there are no flanks,
then there will be no residue distribution bias in these flanks. The problem can be
alleviated by either studying only subsets with minimal flank lengths on both sides
(although datasets might become too small for statistical analysis) or by allowing
flank overlaps between neighbouring TMHs.
iv This classification is even more justified in the light of previous reports about the
“missing hydrophobicity” in multi-pass TMHs [35, 168, 207, 208]. Otherwise, the
distribution bias well observed among the exclusive anchors could be lost to noise.
This addresses the more biologically contextualised issue that there are different
evolutionary pressures on different types of TMHs. The negative charge skew is
most pronounced for dedicated anchors frequently found with simple TMHs typically observed in single-pass TM proteins. These TMHs are pressured to exhibit
residue biases that may aid anchorage in a topologically correct manner. Complex TMHs, typically within multi-pass membrane proteins that have a function
beyond anchorage, comply with a multitude of restraints structural and functional
constraints and the negative charge skew is just one of them.
The most representative precedent papers are those of Sharpe et al. [48] from 2010
(with 1192 human and 1119 yeast single-pass TMHs), Baeza-Delgado et al. [78] (with
792 TMHs mixed from single- and multi-pass TMPs) and Pogozheva et al. [79] (TMHs
from 191 mixed from single- and multi-pass TMPs with structural information) both
from 2013. Whereas the first analysis would have benefited from the central alignment
approach and the first two studies from another normalisation as described above,

2.5. DISCUSSION

81

the third study did come close to our findings. To note, their dataset mixed with
single- and multi-pass proteins was too small for revealing the negative charge bias
with significance; yet, they observed total charge differences at either sides of the
membrane varying for both single- and multi-pass proteins. Membrane asymmetry
due to positively charged residues occurring more frequently on the cytosolic side
causes net charge unevenness at both sides of the membrane. This observation has
been known to correlate with orientation for decades [78, 82, 204]. Our data shows
that the negative charge skew contributes to this asymmetry.
There are differences in charged amino acid residue biases in TMH flanks through
each stage of the secretory pathway
Here, we observe differences throughout sub-cellular locations along the secretory
pathway. We found that negative charges are enriched at the outside flank (in the ER),
both enriched outside and suppressed inside for the Golgi membrane, and suppressed
on the inside flank in the PM. It has been suggested that the leaflets of different
membranes have different lipid compositions throughout the secretory pathway [58]
and this has led to general biochemical conservation in terms of TMH length and
amino acid composition in different membranes [48, 79].
Lipid asymmetry in the Golgi and PM (in contrast to the ER) has been known
about for over a decade [209, 210]. To note, the Golgi and PM have lipid asymmetry with sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids on the non-cytosolic leaflet, and
phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine enriched in the cytosolic leaflet. Although the ER is the main site for cholesterol synthesis, it has markedly low concentrations of sphingolipids [211]. Golgi synthesises sphingomyelin, a lipid not present in
the ER, but present in both the Golgi [212] and in the PM [139, 213]. The PM is also
enriched with densely packed sphingolipids and sterols [214]. Another factor influencing the sequence patterns of TMHs and their along the secretory pathway appears to
be the variation in membrane potentials [69, 70, 72].
Several sequence features can be assigned to anchor TMHs: Charged-residue flank
biases, leucine intra-helix asymmetry, and the “aromatic belt”.
We investigated the difference between TMHs from single-pass and multi-pass proteins and found significant differences in sequence composition that are reflective of the
biologically different roles the TMHs play. To emphasise and validate these findings,

82

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE.

we separated TMHs from single-pass proteins into simple and complex TMHs [23,
38]; ones that likely contains mostly TMHs that act as exclusive anchors, and another
that have roles beyond anchorage. This leaves us with “anchors” (simple TMHs from
single-pass proteins) and “non-anchors” (complex TMHs from single-pass proteins,
and TMHs from multi-pass proteins). If there are strong sequence feature differences
between anchors and non-anchors, it is likely that the sequence feature has a role in
satisfying membrane constraints to act as an energetically optimally stable anchor.
Future studies in the area would desirably directly include a comprehensive analyses
of datasets oligomerised TMHs from single-pass proteins and ascertain if they appear
to be more similar to simple anchors, multi-pass, or generally neither. Currently, no
sufficiently complete set of intra-membrane oligomerised single-pass proteins exists
that can be compared to a large set of known non-oligomerising proteins. The current
work sidesteps this issue by comparing single-pass proteins with simple TMHs, which
tend to be simple anchors (as shown in previous work [23, 38]), against datasets that
contain TMHs that will form intra-membrane bundles. Bluntly, the simple/complex
status of a TMH can be easily computed from its sequence with TMSOC whereas
the oligomerisation state of most membrane proteins still needs to be experimentally
determined.
Unsurprisingly, both positively and negatively charged residues can be seen to be
more strongly distributed with bias in anchors than non-anchors. Both the “positiveinside” rule as well as the “negative-outside/non-negative-inside” bias are mostly observable in simple single-pass TMHs (although they are statistically significant elsewhere). It is perhaps true that where a bias is clearly present in both non-anchors and
anchors alike, it is a strong topological determinant, whereas if the residue is only distributed with topological bias in exclusively anchoring TMHs, we can attribute these
features more specifically to biophysical anchorage. This being said, we should not
rule out that the same features aid topological determination since negative charge has
been shown to be a weaker topological determinant than positively charged residues
(35).
Tyrosine and tryptophan residues commonly are found at the interfacial boundaries
of the TMH and this feature is called the “aromatic belt” [48, 78, 84–86] and this was
thought to be caused by their affinity to the carbonyl groups in the lipid bilayer [215].

2.5. DISCUSSION

83

Not all types of aromatic residues are found in the aromatic belt; phenylalanine has no
particular preference for this region [85, 87]. It is still unclear if the aromatic belt has
to do with anchorage or with translocon recognition [78]. Here, TMHs with exclusively
anchorage functions showed stronger preferences for the W and Y in the aromatic belt
region, otherwise known as the water-lipid interface region than TMHs with function
beyond anchorage. This is strong evidence that the aromatic belt indeed assists with
anchorage, and is less conserved where the TMH must conform to other restraints
beyond membrane anchorage. Furthermore, we see that the tyrosine’s preference for
the inside interface region also appears to be to do with anchorage and this trend is
somewhat true for tryptophan, too.
Finally, our findings corroborate earlier reports that many multi-pass TMHs are
much less hydrophobic than typical single-pass TMH and about 30% of them fail the
hydrophobicity requirements of ∆G TMH insertion prediction (“missing hydrophobicity”) [35, 84, 207, 208]. We also find that the leucine skew and the hydrophobic
asymmetry towards the cytosolic leaflet of the membrane is more pronounced in simple,
single-pass TMHs than in complex or multi-pass ones; thus, it appears to be another
anchoring feature. It was found previously that the hydrophobic profiles of TMHs of
multi-pass proteins share similar hydrophobicity profiles on average irrespective of the
number of TMHs and TMHs from single-pass proteins have been found to be typically more hydrophobic than TMHs from multi-pass proteins [38]. Sharpe et al. [48]
report an asymmetric hydrophobic length for single-pass TMHs. Our study reiterates
the hydrophobic asymmetry and attributes it mainly to the leucine distribution. The
leucine asymmetry might be linked to the different lipid composition of either leaflet
of biological membranes.
In summary, three key features can be assigned to aiding TMH stability in the
membrane (Figure 2.10): (i) charge, (ii) the aromatic belt, and (iii) leucine leaflet
preference. What is most novel here is that each of these features are furthermore
distributed with preference for a particular side of the bilayer in the case of anchoring TMHs. These differences in inside-outside topology that are most present in anchoring TMHs further supports the notion that there are broad lipid compositional
differences between the inner and outer leaflets of the bilayers [48]. Furthermore, while
some TMHs conform and complement to the properties of the bilayer, other TMHs

more classic model of a TMH showing the “positive-inside” rule [82], the hydrophobic core [34], the
polar enrichment that flanks the hydrophobic stretch [78] and the aromatic belt [85]. b Simple anchors may display additional features that conform to the membrane biophysical constraints: further
suppression of charge in the hydrophobic core (Table 2.1), intra-membrane leucine asymmetry that
likely causes hydrophobic skew [48] (Table 2.4, Figure 2.6), a higher preference for cysteine on the
inside flanking region (Figure 2.9K and L), a higher net “positive-inside” charge (Figure 2.4), asymmetric skew of the hydrophobic belt favouring the inner leaflet interface (Figure 2.9E, F, G, and H)
and a negative-outside bias via suppression on the inside flanking region or enrichment on the outside
flanking region (Figure 2.9C and D, Tables 2 and 3)

with function beyond anchorage are less constrained to biophysically complement the
bilayer. For these TMHs, any advantage gained by adhering to the membrane restrictions is outweighed by more complicated protein dynamics, topological frustration and
protein functional requirements.

To conclude, the large fraction of functionally uncharacterised genomic sequences is
the great bottleneck in life sciences at this moment that hinders many biomedical and
biotechnological applications, some with tremendous societal need [182, 216]. Among
these uncharacterised genomic regions, there is ∼10000 protein-coding genes, especially
many membrane-embedded proteins. It is hoped that the NNI/NO-rule as well as the
other sequence properties of membrane anchoring TMHs described in this article will
add new insights for membrane protein function discovery, design and engineering.

Datasets

85

Databases.
All datasets used for analysis are listed in Table 2.1. Transmembrane protein sequences
and annotations were taken from TOPDB [197] and UniProt [36]. UniProt derived
datasets are the most comprehensive datasets built with (i) robust transmembrane
prediction methods providing the limit of todays achievable accuracy with regard to
hydrophobic core localisation and (ii) subcellular location annotation that can be used
for orientation determination. However, they mostly rely on predicted transmembrane
regions. TOPDB has meticulous experimental verifications of the orientation from
the literature that are independent of prediction algorithms [197]. Unfortunately, this
dataset is much smaller with too few entries to have it divided with regard to taxonomy
or subcellular locations.
UniProt database files were downloaded by querying the server for different taxonomic groups as well as different subcellular membrane locations; UniHuman (human
representative proteome), UniCress (Arabidopsis thaliana, otherwise known as mouse
eared cress, representative proteome), UniER (human endoplasmic reticulum representative proteome), UniPM (human plasma membrane representative proteome),
UniGolgi (human Golgi representative proteome). To enforce a level of quality control,
the queries were restricted to manually reviewed records and transmembrane proteins
with manually asserted TRANSMEM annotation [36]. Proteins were then sorted into
multi-pass and single-pass groups according to having more than one or exactly one
TRANSMEM region respectively. TRANSMEM regions are validated by either experimental evidence [36], or according to a robust transmembrane consensus of the
predictors TMHMM [28], Memsat [27], Phobius [32, 177] and the hydrophobic moment plot method of Eisenberg and co-workers [111]. TMHs and flanking regions were
oriented according to UniProt TOPO DOM annotation according to the keyword “cytoplasmic”. If a “cytoplasmic” TOPO DOM was found in the previous TOPO DOM
relative to the TRANSMEM region then the sequence remained the same. If “cytoplasmic” was found in the next TOPO DOM, relative to the TRANSMEM section

86

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE.

then the sequence was reversed. Proteins without the “cytoplasmic” keyword in their
TOPO DOM annotation were omitted from further analysis.
The TOPDB database [197] is a manually curated database composed of experimental records from the literature that allow determination of the protein topology.
Experiments include fusion proteins, posttranslational modifications, protease experiments, immunolocalization, chemical modifications as well as revertants, sequence
motifs with known mandatory membrane-embedded topologies, and tailoring mutants
(Table 2.7).
Length cut-offs for the TMH were set at 16 as the shortest length and 38 as the
longest.
To note, we are aware that proteome datasets are a moving target that have dramatically changed over the years and, probably, will continue to do so to some extent
in the future[83]. Yet, we think that currently available protein sequence sets are sufficiently good for the purpose as we search for statistical properties in the TMH context
only.
The following datasets are used throughout this work:

ExpAll
TOPDB contained 4190 manually annotated transmembrane proteins at the time of
download [197]. CD-HIT [217] identified 3857 representative sequences using sequence
clusters of >90% sequence identity. This choice of similarity threshold was chosen since
CD-HIT ultimately underlies the clustering behind UniRef. Unlike the other datasets,
which by definition contain reasonably typical TMHs, many of the transmembrane
segments annotated in TOPDB are extremely short or long and this would cause
severe unrealistic hydrophobic mismatches. Especially, the short segments could be
the result of miss-annotation, TMHs broken into pieces due to kinks or segments that
peripherally insert only into the interface of the membrane bilayer. To remove the
atypical lengths, cut-offs were set at 16 as the lower cut-off and 38 as the upper cut-off
after inspecting the length histogram. We found that, for the single-pass TMHs in
TOPDB, 1215 out of 1544 are within the length limits (78.7%). Among the 17141
multi-pass TMHs, we find 15563 within our global length limits (from 2205 TOPDB
records corresponding to 2281 UniProt entries). This removed 1578 very short TMHs

and none of the long TMHs. Our cut-off selection is very similar to the one by BaezaDelgado et al. [78].
To get an idea of the taxonomical breakdown in the ExpAll dataset, the UniProt
ID tags were extracted and mapped to UniProtKB. The combined dataset of multipass (single-pass) proteins was mapped to 1288 (1343) eukaryotic records, 404 (776)
of which were human records, 926 (191) bacterial records, 46 (5) archaea records, and
14 (22) viral records.

UniHuman
This is a set of mostly human TMH-containing proteins or their close mammalian
homologues.

UniProtKB contains 5187 human protein records that are manu-

ally annotated with TRANSMEM regions (query = “annotation:(type:transmem)
AND reviewed:yes AND organism:“Homo sapiens (Human) [9606]” AND proteome:up000005640”. To reduce sequence redundancy, these sequences were submitted
to UniRef90 [218]. To note, UniRef90 was chosen over UniRef50 to maintain a viable
size of datasets for statistical analysis of occurrence of negatively charged residue,
which are very rare in the vicinity of TMHs. 5015 UniRef90 clusters represented the
5187 sequences. A list of sequences representing those clusters was submitted back
to UniProtKB resulting and 5014 representative entries were recovered. There is a
small issue in that the list of representatives from UniRef includes non-canonical isoforms, while the batch retrieve query of UniProtKB only supports complete entries, i.e.
canonical isoforms. This resulted in the loss of one record at this point is due to two
splice isoforms acting as representative identifiers. Of those 5014 records, 4714 were
records from human entries, 197 were from mice, 94 from rats, 5 from bovine, 2 from
chimps, 1 from Chinese hamsters, and 1 from pigs. Although the TMH length variations within the UniHuman dataset are much smaller than for ExpAll, we applied
the same length cut-offs for the sake of comparability. Out of the 1709 single-pass
cases, 1705 entered the final dataset. Of those, 1596 were from human records, 87
were from mouse, 19 were from rat, and 2 were from chimpanzee. Among the 12390
multi-pass TMHs, 12353 were included into UniHuman. The other, multi-pass record
identifiers were mapped to 1789 UniProtKB entries. 1660 of these were human entries,

The clustered human dataset was queried using UniProtKB for Golgi subcellular location (locations:(location:“Golgi apparatus [SL-0132]” evidence:manual)). This returned 323 protein entries, 301 of which belonged to human, 19 to mice, 2 to rat and
1 to pig. 269 of these records contained sufficient annotation for orientation determination. 206 were single-pass entries of which 195 records were from human, 9 from
mouse, and 1 from rat. 61 were multi-pass entries containing 383 transmembrane

For the mouse ear cress, a representative proteome dataset was acquired with the query
annotation:proteomes:(reference:yes) AND reviewed:yes AND organism:“Arabidopsis
thaliana (Mouse-ear cress) [3702]” AND proteome:up000006548. This returned 3174
records in UniProtKB. UniRef90 identified 3111 clusters. 3110 of the representative
sequences were mapped back to UniProtKB. Of those, 3090 were from Arabidopsis
thaliana, 2 from Hornwort, 1 from cucumber, 1 from tall dodder, 1 from soybean

annotation for topological orientation determination. 632 of those records were identified as single-pass, all of which were from Arabidopsis thaliana. 507 protein records
were from multi-pass records, which contained 3823 transmembrane helices. 506 of
those records were from Arabidopsis thaliana, whilst 1 was from Thermosynechococcus elongatus.

UniFungi

For the Fungi dataset, the query “annotation:(type:transmem) taxonomy:“Fungi

successfully mapped back to UniProtKB. Of those, 2070 had suitable annotation for
orientation. 1990 records belonged to Ascomycota including 1243 Saccharomycetales.
73 were Basidomycota, and 6 were Apansporoblastina. 729 records contained a single TMH region, 702 of which belonged to Ascomycota, 26 to Basidomycota and one
to Encephalitozoon cuniculi, a Microsporidium parasite. 8698 helices were contained
in 1338 records of multi-pass proteins. Of these records 1285 were Ascomycota, 47
were Basidomycota, and 5 were Apansporoblastina. One TMH from UniFungi was
discounted from P32897 due to an unknown position.

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE.

2.6.2

On the determination of flanking regions for transmembrane helices and the transmembrane helix alignment

The determination of the boundary point at the sequence between the TMH in a
membrane and the sequence immersed in the cytoplasm, extracellular space, vesicular
lumen, etc. is not that trivial as it initially appears. There is a lot of dynamics in
the TMH positioning and the actual boundary point will be represented by various
residues at different time points. Whilst the TMH core region detection from a sequence is trivial with modern software, the exact determination of TMH boundaries
remains difficult since it is unclear exactly how far in or out of the membrane a given
helix extends [173]. Previous studies have dealt with this issue in various ways [48,
78, 79, 219].
Here in this work, we explore two boundary definitions. First, we assign TMH
boundary locations as described in the respective databases. These flanks are the ones
that are reported in our TMH data files that are available at the WWW-site associated
with this paper. We studied flank lengths of ±5, ±10, and ±20 residues preceding
and following the inside and outside TMH boundaries. In these cases, the flanks are
aligned relative to the residue closest to the TMH.
In cases where the loops before and after the TMH are shorter than the predefined
flank lengths, further precautions are necessary. In the multi-pass datasets particularly
(Figure 2.11 & Figure 2.4), the flanks overlap with other membrane region flanks. We
explore several variants. On the one hand, we work with data files where the flank
residue stretches are equally truncated so that no overlap occurs. If the loop length was
uneven, the central odd residue was not included into any flank. We find surprisingly,
that a large number of TMH has no or just a super-short flank, a circumstance that
should disturb any statistical analysis due to the absence of objects. Therefore, we also
work with alternative datasets (i) with flanks overlapping between consecutive TMH
(e.g., in Table 3B; yet, it leads to some residues being counted more than one time)
as well as (ii) with subsets of the data where the flanks at both sides have a defined
minimal length (50% or 100% of the required flanks; unfortunately, some of them
become too small for analysis).

Figure 2.11: The lengths of flanks and TMHs in multi-pass and single-pass proteins in
the UniHuman and ExpAll dataset.On the horizontal axis are the lengths of the TM segment
regions in residues. On the vertical axis are the percentages of the population. There are three
regions: the inside flank, the TMH and the outside flank. These regions are acquired according to
the TMH boundary of the respective database. Where no overlap is permitted, if the flank encroaches
the flank of another TMH, the flank length becomes half the number of residues in the loop region
between the two features. Where they are allowed to overlap, flanking residues may include other
flanks, or indeed other TMHs.

The problem of flanks overlapping does affect also some single-pass and multipass TMH proteins with INTRAMEM regions as described in some UniProt entries.
We do not include INTRAMEM regions in the datasets as TMHs but, sometimes, the
flanking regions of TMHs were truncated to avoid overlap with INTRAMEM flanking
regions (Supplementary Table S2). The identifiers affected for single-pass TMH proteins are Q01628, P13164, Q01629, Q5JRA8, A2ANU3 (UniHuman), P13164, Q01629,
A2ANU3 (UniPM) and Q5JRA8 (UniER).
The second form of boundary point definition for flank determination was achieved
with gaplessly aligning all TMHs relative to their central residue at the position equal
to half the length of the TMHs at either side. Though there is some length variation
among TMHs, most of them are centred around a length of 20-22 residues. In this case,
flanks are the sequence extensions beyond the standardised-length 21-residues TMHs.
We define the inside flanking segments as the positions -20 to -10 and the outside
flanking regions to be +10 to +20 from the central TMH residue (with the label
“0”). Instead of emphasising some artificially selected boundary residue, this definition

2.6.3

Separating simple and complex single-pass helices.

Single-pass helices from ExpAll and UniHuman datasets helices were split into two
groups: simple and complex following a previously described classification [23, 38]
to roughly distinguish simple hydrophobic anchors and TMHs with additional structural/functional roles.

Simple and complex helices were determined using TM-

SOC [23]. The complexity class is determined by calculating the hydrophobicity
and sequence entropy. The resulting coordinates cluster with anchors being more
hydrophobic and less complex whilst more complex and more polar TMHs are associated with non-anchorage functions. In UniHuman there were 889 simple helices and
570 complex TMHs. In ExpAll there were 769 simple helices and 570 complex helices.

2.6.4

Distribution normalisation

In this work, we have used normalisation techniques described in previous investigations as well as new approaches designed to more sensitively identify biases of rare
residues. Baeza-Delgado and co-workers used LogOdds normalisation column-wise

2.6. METHODS

95

in TMH alignments. Critically, this is based on their definition of probability, which
takes into account the total number of amino acids in the dataset as a denominator [78]. Since aliphatic residues such as leucine and other highly abundant slightly polar residues dominate the denominator, the distribution of the rare acidic residues will
be easily lost in the “background noise” of those highly abundant residues. Pogozheva
and co-workers used two approaches, (i) the total accessible surface area (ASAtotal)
and (ii) total number of charged residues (Ntotal ) as a denominator in their distribution
normalisation [79].
In this work, two methods for measuring residue occurrence in the TMH and its
flanks were used. Similarly to previous work, we compute the occurrence of an amino
acid type at a certain sequence position in a set of aligned sequences TMHs and their
flanks. Following [48], the absolute relative occurrence of this amino acid type at the
sequence position is then given by Equation 2.1 as:

pi,r =

ai,r
max(ar )

(2.1)

r

Here, the denominator is the maximal number of all residues in any alignment
column (i.e., the number of sequences in the alignment) and, to emphasise, this will
make mostly dependent on the most abundant residue types. This type of normalisation reveals the most preferred residue types at given sequence positions.
Our second normalisation method is independent of the abundance of any amino
acid types other than the studied one; it answers the question: “If there is a residue of
type in the TMH-containing segment, where would it most likely be?” This relative
occurrence calculated in Equation 2.2 as:

qi,r =

100 · ai,r
ai

(2.2)

The value ai is the total abundance of residues of just amino acid type i in a
given alignment of TMH-containing segments (i.e., in the TMH together with its two
adjoining flanks summed over all cases of TMHs in the given dataset). Peaks in qi,r
as function of r reveal the preferred positions of residues of type i. The difference in
qi,r and pi,r normalisation is visualised in Figure 2.12.

Figure 2.12: Relative percentage heatmaps from the predictive datasets calculated by
fractions of the absolute maximum and by the relative percentage of a given amino acid
type.The residue position aligned to the centre of the TMH is on the horizontal axis, and the residue
type is on the vertical axis. Amino acid types are listed in order of decreasing hydrophobicity according
to the Kyte and Doolittle scale [34]. The flank lengths in the TMH segments were restricted to up
to ±5 residues. The scales for each heatmap are shown beneath the respective subfigure. All TMHs
and flank lengths are from the UniHuman dataset. (A) The heatmap has been coloured according
to a scale that uses column-wise normalisations used in previous studies [48]. See Equation 2.1. As
an illustrative example, we show how the value for E at position ±12 is obtained. There are in total
91/22 Es at these positions in 1705 sequences; thus, the represented value is 0.013 at 12 and 0.053 at
12. Note that L is clearly a hotspot as well as trends for other hydrophobic residues, I and V, as is to
be expected. A positive inside effect can also be seen. (B) The heatmap has been coloured according
to the relative percentage of each amino acid type (Equation 2.2). Here, 91/22 Es at position ±12 are
compared with 615 Es seen within the flanks and the TMH section itself amongst all sequences in the
alignment. So, the expectation of an E at position ±12 if there is any E in the TMH + flanks region
at all is 0.036 at 12 and 0.148 at position 12. With this type of normalisation, not surprisingly, we
see the positive-inside rule is hotter than in subfigure A. There are also hotspots in the flanks for the
negatively charged residues on the outside flank. The leucine hotspot is no longer very pronounced,
as the leucines are quite evenly spread over many positions.

2.6.5

Hydrophobicity calculations

Hydrophobicity profiles were calculated using the Kyte & Doolittle hydrophobicity
scale [34] and validated with the Eisenberg scale [111], the Hessa biological scale [84],
and the White and Wimley whole residue scale [106](Figure 2.7). The hydrophobicity

2.6. METHODS

97

profile uses un-weighted windowing of the residue hydrophobicity scores from end to
end of the TMD slice. Three residues were used as full window lengths and partial
windows were permitted.

2.6.6

Normalised net charge calculations

Charge was calculated at each position by scanning through each position of the transmembrane helices and flanking regions and subtracting one from the position if an
acidic residue (D or E) was present, or adding one if a positively charged residue (K or
R) was present. The accumulative net-charge was then divided by the total number
of transmembrane helices that were used in calculating the accumulative net-charge.
Thus, the charge distribution is calculated by:

cr =

2.6.7

(aK,r + aR,r ) − (aD,r + aE,r )
N

(2.3)

Statistics

The inside/outside bias of negative residues was quantified by computing the independent KW and the 2-sample t-test statistical method from the Python scipy stat package
v0.15 python package [220]. This test answers the question whether two means are actually different in the statistical sense. For the leucine residues, each TMH region was
divided into two sections, representing the inner and outer leaflets ( Table 2.4). For the
hydrophobicity plot, 3 window values of hydrophobicity were taken for each TMH at
each position. The statistical analyses were separately performed for single-pass and
multi-pass transmembrane proteins. At each position, the two groups were compared
using the KW test.
The zero hypothesis of homogeneity of two distributions was examined with the KS,
the KW and the χ2 statistical tests. To note, the KS test scrutinises for significant
maximal absolute differences between distribution curves; the KW test is after skews
between distributions and the χ2 statistical test checks the average difference between
distributions. As the statistical significance value (“Pvalue”) is a strong function of N,
the total amount of data used in the statistical test, we rely on the (absolute) Bahadur
slope (B) as a measure of distance between two distributions [199, 200]:

Abstract

TA proteins are a functionally diverse group of post-translationally inserted membrane
proteins that have a cytosolic N-terminal, a transmembrane α helix, and a short C-terminal tail. The TMH and flanking regions of the TA protein have been shown to
contain sufficient information for subcellular targeting. Here, we built datasets based
on sequence definitions of plausible TA proteins using the UniProt database. We show
that any statistical differences between the hydrophobicity of the TMH between TA
proteins belonging to mammalian, plant, or yeast organisms are, if at all present, small.
99

CHAPTER 3. COLLATION AND ANALYSIS OF TAIL-ANCHORED...

Yet, the hydrophobicity of TMHs from different subcellular locations is, on average,
different between the mitochondria and other membranes along the secretory pathway.
Notably, in the case of mitochondria, this appears to be a difference in the hydrophobic
residue preference of alanine instead of leucine or isoleucine and does not seem to
be an increase of intramembrane polar residues. In the ER, Golgi, and PM there
are positively charged residues inside the cytoplasm and negatively charged residues
outside. Yet we identify a charge skew reversal of the “positive-inside” and “negativeoutside” rules in the mitochondrial TA proteins to negative-inside and positive-outside.
Whether these differences are the result of membrane environment adaptations or
biological features useful for the biogenesis and accurate localisation of the protein
remains unclear. Furthermore, structural homology modelling of the spontaneously
inserting TMHs of PTP1b and cytochrome b5 revealed that TA proteins may gain their
ability to integrate into the membrane unaided due to a strip of conserved relatively
polar residues and strong flanking charge that would allow effective membrane coupling
and anchoring.

3.2

Introduction

TA proteins are defined by their single carboxy-terminal TMH with a cytosolic facing
amino-terminus and are a topologically distinct class of intracellular proteins. The
integration of TA proteins into the membrane is post-translational rather than cotranslational; the ribosome is not in complex with the membrane bound insertion
machinery.

TA proteins are involved in a range of key cellular functions such as

translocation [221] (Sec61β and Sec61γ) and apoptosis (Bcl-2 apoptotic protein family) [222]. Additionally, within the TA class of proteins are a set of vesicle fusion
proteins called Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor
(SNARE) proteins [223], which contain typically hydrophobic TMHs [224]. The idea
that SNARE proteins are modular and capable of spontaneous insertion has significant implications for both biomedical application in liposome-based drug delivery.
Furhtermore, this could can aid future research for testing complex biological molecular networks [225, 226].
The TA protein’s TMH is unusual in that it is both the anchor and the targeting

3.2. INTRODUCTION

101

factor for the ER [227]. Furthermore, the hydrophobicity appears to be a determining factor in the delivery pathway that TA proteins use for insertion [228, 229], for
which there is evidence demonstrating that there are several mechanisms of translocation [229, 230](Figure 3.1).
TA proteins have several pathways for biogenesis in the ER membrane. TA proteins
were originally thought to be inserted into the membrane via different machinery than
the co-translational machinery, but unexpectedly SRP was found to be a factor for
post-translational targeting confirmed by both cross-linking studies [231] and an in
vitro pull-down experiment [232]. SRP would deliver the TA protein to the membranebound SR in association with a highly conserved Sec translocon. Further cross-linking
experiments suggested Sec61 is also involved during TA protein membrane insertion
[233]. Previous studies had shown the Sec61 translocon is not necessary for TA protein
membrane integration by biochemical reconstitution experiments [227] and conditional
mutants in yeast [234, 235]. So whilst it is hard to determine if Sec61 can be part
of the post-translational pathway, we can conclude that it is certainly not essential,
indeed almost no observable impact on biogenesis is had when it is removed [227, 234,
235]. Nevertheless, this suggests the possibility of at least one insertion mechanism
that is related to the co-translational method of insertion. Most likely is that SRP
binds to the TA protein after it is released from the ribosome and chaperones it until
it is close enough to the established post translational machinery [236] (Figure 3.1iii).
A second redundant system is also known to be involved in TA protein biogenesis
and is referred to as the TRC40 (also known as Asna1) pathway in mammals (Figure
3.1i). A conserved homologue was found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Get3 [237], and
so in yeast, this mechanism is generally referred to as the Get pathway. Unlike cotranslational insertion, the post-translational chaperone proteins do not couple with
the ribosome, so the TA protein must be exposed to the cytosolic environment for at
least some time [39]. At some point after the TA protein emerges from the ribosomal
exit tunnel, the TA protein TMH associates with Sgt2 (SGTA in mammals). An
in vitro assay revealed that Sgt2 associates with Get5 [238] (UBL4A) as part of a
dimerised Get4 (TRC35) and Get5 complex (two copies of each)[239–242]. At this
point Sgt2 either associates with preferential Get3 which targets the TA protein for
ER membrane biogenesis or if there are excess TA proteins Sgt2 also associates with

(i) The intensively studied Get (yeast) or TRC40 (mammalian) pathway can target either for membrane integration or degradation of the TA protein. (ii) In
yeast, a novel mechanism was identified in which Snd1 binds to the folded TA protein and delivers it to the membrane-bound Snd2 and Snd3 complex. (iii)
SRP of the co-translational insertion mechanism has been shown to be able to integrate TA proteins. Sec61s role in this is disputed, and it is likely other
proteins are involved in membrane partitioning instead. (iv) A recently identified insertase, the EMC, can integrate TA proteins with relatively polar TMHs
into the ER. (v) A handful of TA proteins with relatively polar TMH regions have been observed spontaneously integrating into the membrane using Hsp40 and
Hsc70 as chaperones. This system may be employed for mitochondrial localisation. (vi) Peroxisomal proteins with an abundance of charge in the tail region are

Bag6 which targets the TA protein for degradation [243]. This “race” between Bag6
and Get3 ensures a level of quality control within the system. Assuming the TA
protein is not targeted for degradation, Get3 associates first with this complex via an
interaction with the N-terminal of Get4 [238]. A dimerised ADP-bound Get3 [244–
248] associates with and shields the C-terminal region of the TA protein [237, 249,
250]. This shielding may be especially important since Get3 is involved in the folding
of any nascent TA proteins, which would be an unviable hydrophobic in the cytosol
[251]. Fluorescence studies revealed that tagged Get3 appears at both the cytosol and
the ER membrane so apparently shuttles the TA protein between the transmembrane
complex of Get1 and Get 2 (WRB and CAML in mammalian cells), that contains
cytosolic domains that receive the Get3, Get4, Get5, Sgt2 complex [252, 253]. Yet
it is an interesting note that a single molecule fluorescence study revealed that the
minimum machinery required for TA protein insertion from this system is a Get1 and
Get2 heterodimer [253]. The Get pathway exclusively delivers TA proteins to the
ER membrane, and indeed has been recently shown to be responsible for some of the
mislocalisation of mitochondrial TA proteins during overexpression or signal masking
to the ER [254]. The significance of this is that the Get machinery can recognise and
tolerate integration of non-ER proteins. Yet there is also evidence that the deep groove
of Get3 [255, 256] predisposes it to only effectively integrating the more hydrophobic
TMHs of TA proteins [238, 257]. As an example, increasing the hydrophobicity of the
TA protein squaline synthase in a TRC40 inhibited system reduced the biogenesis of
the protein, where the wild-type was unaffected by TRC40 inhibition [258]. Around a
half of TA proteins are estimated to not use the TRC pathway [258].
Redundancy of the Get/TRC40 pathway and SRP pathway may be explained in
part by a novel SRP and Get independent pathway. This pathway utilises the Snd
protein pathway and was discovered in yeast [259] (Figure 3.1ii). Snd1 binds to the
TA protein after it exits the ribosome and delivers it to the Snd2 and Snd3 membrane-bound complex which integrates the TA protein into the membrane. So far only the
homologue of Snd2 has been identified (hSnd2) with relatively low sequence identity
[260]. However, it is suspected that functional mammalian homologues exist for Snd1
and Snd3 also, albeit with low sequence similarity.
Even more recently identified as a TA protein insertase was the EMC [258] (Figure

104

3.1iv). In the interaction study, squaline synthase did not effectively crosslink with any
TRC pathway machinery. Calmodulin sufficiently prevented aggregation and acted as
a chaperone in ER microsomes in a chaperone free E. coli translation system with
purified translation factors. In this system, calmodulin acted similarly to SGTA, and
although in native cytosol calmodulin was preferred, SGTA could also be used by the
protein. By contrast VAMP2, a TA protein known to interact with TRC40 [243], was
unable to insert in this system. Abolition by knock outs of the EMC components
greatly reduced the insertion potential of squaline synthase, along with five mutants
thereof, and six other TRC40 independent proteins in ER membranes from semipermeabilised cultured cells, but not that of VAMP2. Insertion of Sec61β was partially
dependent on both systems, perhaps indicating the midway point between the two [258]
(Figure 3.1).
In the absence of the mitochondrial TIM-TOM insertion machinery and Get machinery, Hsp40 and Hsc70 chaperones along with ATP are also sufficient for enough
biogenesis of TA proteins for viable cell growth [228, 229, 261–265]. In biological systems, this is possibly used for mitochondrial delivery [263] (Figure 3.1 (v)). Chimeric
synaptobrevin, one of the first identified SNARE proteins, is capable of this spontaneous insertion if the tail anchor domain is replaced by the TM domains belonging to a
protein of known spontaneously inserting domains, i.e spontaneous insertion is a property of the TMH, not of the rest of the protein [226]. Molecular dynamics simulations
showed that direct insertion TMHs thermodynamically mimics the energies of TMHs
integrated by the translocon [266] so in theory, no integration machinery is strictly
necessary if the TMH can “correctly” interact with the membrane interface. Further,
it was revealed that scrambling the TMH sequence, but maintaining hydrophobicity,
reduced the insertion potential of spontaneously inserting TMHs [105]. This phenomenon cannot, therefore, be explained entirely by the marginal hydrophobicity of
the TMH.
The few peroxisomal TA proteins first associate with Pex19 which forms a complex
with the membrane-anchored Pex3 protein from which the TA protein is integrated
into the membrane [267–269](Figure 3.1vi).
Given a “choice”, it is speculated that hydrophobicity determines the integration

pathway since Sec61β has a hydrophobic TMH and is targeted via the SRP pathway, whereas marginally hydrophobic TA proteins like cytochrome b5 and PTP1b can
spontaneously insert in vitro and biologically only rely on Hsp70 and Hsc40. Altering
the hydrophobicity, at least in the case of the spontaneously inserting PTP1b, also
determines the localisation of the TA protein to either the mitochondrial membrane
or the ER membrane, or rather a more hydrophobic TA protein TMH is less likely
to localise to the mitochondrial membrane [270]. Broader analysis has shown that
hydrophobicity [106] stratified by TM tendency score [175] can distinguish between
the ER and mitochondrial localised TA proteins [39]. However, the tremendous diversity and known biogenesis redundancy of these proteins may mean that no single
factor applied en masse may be able to distinguish the TMH recognition factors and
investigation into this area is becoming increasingly complex [39].
By regenerating a list of likely TMHs [224] and using a manually curated list of TA
proteins [36], this investigation aims to find relationships between biochemical factors
and a disposition to a certain insertion mechanism and terminal localisations. Here,
we also present evidence for a conserved polar strip along the spontaneously inserting
TA protein TMHs, which may be the key to the initial interaction of these TMHs with
the membrane interface.

Building a List of Tail-Anchors

Steps carried out by Kalbfleisch et al. (Traffic 8: 16871694) to generate a list of all
TA proteins in the human proteome [224] were recreated using up to date tools and
applied to other model representative species. Whilst their study focused on the human
proteome, here we take into account the entire TrEMBL and SwissProt database and
then stratify the datasets by the organism at the end of the pipeline. An overview of
the generation of these datasets is shown in Figure 3.2.

SwissProt Tail Anchored Dataset According to Filters
There were 557012 protein records downloaded from SwissProt via UniProt [36] (downloaded 24–04–2018). 106149 TMHs (TRANSMEM annotation) were found between 76953

3.3. METHODS

records (annotation:(type:transmem)ANDreviewed:no). This keyword is contained
in a record according to either experimental evidence [36] or a conservative metaanalysis of TMH prediction using TMHMM [28], Memsat [27], Phobius [32, 177] and
the hydrophobic moment plot method of Eisenberg and co-workers [111]. 11141 of
those records had only a single TMH. 11110 of those TMHs were within the length
thresholds of 16 to 30 residues (None of those had the annotation for splice isoforms
according to NON_TER annotation). 5548 of those had had no SP annotation (SIGNAL).
4332 of those had annotation (based on TOPO_DOM annotation) that the N terminal was
cytoplasmic. 615 of those had the TMH within 25 residues of the C-terminal, the same
threshold used by Kalbfleisch et al., [224]. Running CD-Hit 4.5.3 on the WebMGA
web-server [217, 271] at 90% identical sequence at 90% coverage thresholds resulted
in 443 representative proteins. This threshold was chosen as a compromise between
avoiding over-representation of a certain protein and maintaining a viable sample size.
From this representative list, 46 were Archaeal, 66 were bacterial, and 320 were
eukaryotic and 11 came from dsDNA viruses. When counting proteomes with greater
than 20 records, 49 belonged to the A. thaliana proteome, 48 to Mus musculus
(Mouse), 46 to the Homo sapiens proteome, 24 to S.cerevisiae.
65 were annotated under the mitochondrion location (query locations:
(location:"Mitochondrion[SL-0173]")), 157 in the PM (query locations:
(location:"Cellmembrane[SL-0039]"),

82 in the Golgi (query locations:

(location:"Golgiapparatus[SL-0132]")), and 98 in the ER (query locations:
(location:"Endoplasmicreticulum[SL-0095]"). Only 16 records were found for
the peroxisome (query locations:(location:"Endoplasmicreticulum[SL-0204]")
which is not high enough a sample size for accurate statistical analysis.

TrEMBL Tail Anchored Dataset According to Filters
111425234 records were stored in the TrEMBL database at the time of download (downloaded 25–04–2018). 22107826 of those contained TRANSMEM annotation
(annotation:(type:transmem)ANDreviewed:no). 18053 of these were single-pass
proteins. All of these were within the length restrictions of between 16 and 35 residues
for the TMH region. 17973 of those did not contain a signal sequence when looking

108

CHAPTER 3. COLLATION AND ANALYSIS OF TAIL-ANCHORED...

for SIGNAL annotation. 5157 of those contained a cytoplasmically located N terminal according to TOPO_DOM annotation. 155 records had a TMH within 25 residues
of the C-terminal residue. When considering which species these records come from,
no more than 1 record belonged to any given species. To avoid representing a well-annotated SwissProt record that includes species annotation by a poorly annotated
TrEMBL record without species annotation, these TrEMBL records were omitted from
the sequence redundancy protocol and further analysis.

UniProt Curated List
A query for locations:(location:"Single\--passtypeIVmembraneprotein[SL-9908]
") was used in UniProt which returned 2633 UniProtKB IDs; 463 SwissProt results
and 2170 TrEMBL results. Type IV anchors are sometimes split into two topological
groups; A (A cytosolic facing N terminal domain) and B (The N terminal is targeted
to the lumen), however, the UniProt nomenclature is strictly N terminal being
cytosolic. This manually created list contained some TA proteins that didn’t exactly
fit the generally accepted definition of a TA protein and were excluded from further
analysis. These could be examples of misannotation in the databases or exceptional
TA proteins that behave as post-translationally inserted TA proteins despite not
matching the exact criteria. 101 exceeded the TA length restrictions of 25 residues
between the TMH and the terminal residue. 8 contained annotation for SIGNAL,
indicating an SP, inconsistent with the TA protein definition. 20 were multipass
proteins. A full list of which records exceeded these limits and by how much is
included in the supplementary files. Running these records through CD-HIT at 90%
redundancy yielded 956 clusters; 269 SwissProt records and 687 TrEMBL records [217,
271]. No further filters were applied to this list. Proteomes represented by more than
20 records include A. thaliana (53 records), Human (30), Mus musculus (30), and S.
cerevisiae (27).
426 were annotated under the mitochondrion location (query locations:
(location:"Mitochondrion[SL-0173]")) 47 from SwissProt and 379 automatically assigned in TrEMBL. 397 in the ER (query locations:(location:
"Endoplasmicreticulum[SL-0095]")), 88 from SwissProt and 308 automatically annotated in TrEMBL. 1 TrEMBL record (UniProt ID A0A1E5RT24) in the ER set

contained an “X” residue in the C-terminal flank and was omitted from the analyses. Two subcellular location datasets had no automatically ascribed records and only
contained manually annotated SwissProt records; 31 in the PM (query locations:
(location:"Cellmembrane[SL-0039]"), and 83 in the Golgi (query locations:
(location:"Golgiapparatus[SL-0132]")). There were only 8 TA proteins located
in the peroxisome (locations:(location:"Golgiapparatus[SL-0204]")), making
them an unsuitable dataset for statistical analysis.
Remapping The Previous Dataset
189 of the 411 proteins from the previous Kalbfleisch et al., 2007 study [224] were
successfully mapped to 222 UniProtKB IDs using the UniProt mapping tools with the
RefSeq Protein to UniProtKB option [36].
Tail Anchor Protein Chaperone Interactors
As discussed in the introduction text, there is evidence surrounding the TMH biochemical factors that determine which chaperone will interact with a given TA protein. To
gain a more quantitative understanding of the relationship between the TA protein
TMH and the potential chaperones, it would be ideal to have a large TA dataset
stratified by known chaperone interactions.
Known interactor lists from BioGrid from the chaperones were checked against the
SwissProt automatically filtered and the UniProt curated TA protein datasets. There
were 91 interaction pairs for Hsp40 (Biogrid ID 119699) which mapped to 206 UniProt
records. Hsc70 (Biogrid ID 109544) had 534 interaction pairs 61 of which were mapped
to 91 UniProt records. Hsp40 and Hsc70 both returned 0 record hits after filtering the
UniProt records IDs through the UniProt manually curated list and the automatically
generated SwissProt list both before redundancy removal.
Snd1 (Biogrid ID 32240) had 237 interaction pairs which mapped to 239 records.
Snd1 returned 15 hits when filtering it through the TA datasets.
SGT2 (BioGrid ID 34410) had 260 BioGrid interactor ids which mapped to 264
UniProt records. SGTA (BioGrid ID 112347) had 155 interactor ids from BioGrid,
153 of which were mapped to 274 records. SGT2 and SGTA returned 14 and 5 hits
respectively.

110

CHAPTER 3. COLLATION AND ANALYSIS OF TAIL-ANCHORED...

50 BioGrid ids from TRC40 (Biogrid ID 106931) interaction pairs were mapped to
90 UniProt records. Get3 (BioGrid ID 31962) had 456 Biogrid interactor ids, which
mapped to 465 UniProt records. After filtering those records through the TA anchor
datasets TRC40 and Get3 returned 7 and 22 hits respectively.
In yeast, Pex19 (BioGrid ID 31994) contained 466 interactor pairs which mapped
to 384 UniProt IDs. The Homo sapiens Pex19 (BioGrid ID 111782) contained 230
interaction pairs which successfully mapped to 218 UniProt records. When the TA
list filters were applied, 2 Homo sapiens and 7 Saccharomyces cerevisiae records were
found.
For SRP54, ideally the plant version of the protein was required, for which there
is more precedent for post-translational protein interaction and biogenesis into the
chloroplasts [231], however, of the 3 plant SRPs available on Biogrid, between them
only 10 interactor pairs were available, none of which were common with our TA
lists. The human SRP54 (Biogrid ID 112607) had 37 interactors which mapped to 85
UniProt IDs, but again, none of which were in our TA lists. On the other hand, the
yeast SRP54 (BioGrid ID 36258) had 270 interactors which mapped to 273 UniProt
records. 4 of those were found in our TA lists.

3.3.2

Calculating Hydrophobicity

Windowed hydrophobicity was calculated using a window length of 5 residues, and half
windows were permitted. Average hydrophobicity takes the total of the raw amino
acid hydrophobicity values and divides them by the number of amino acids in the
slice. Unless explicitly stated, values reported in the results are based on the Kyte &
Doolittle scale [34] which is based on the water–vapour transfer free energy and the
interior-exterior distribution of individual amino acids.

3.3.3

Calculating Sequence Information Entropy

Information entropy is essentially an estimate of the linguistic entropy of a string. In
the context of biology, it can be thought of as an estimation of the non-randomness
of a sequence. Sequence complexity can be used to analyse DNA sequences [114–
116] and is a component of the TMSOC z-score which can predict function beyond

3.3. METHODS

111

anchoring of a TMH; an increase in complexity is associated with increased likelihood
of function [23, 38, 167]. Here we focus on the analysis of the complexity of a string
of characters in protein sequences.
Broadly speaking, the information theory entropy of a linguistic string can be
defined as in equation 3.1, and we treat the protein sequence TMH as a string with or
without its flanking regions.

H(S) = −

n
X
pi · logp
i=1

i

log2

(3.1)

Where H is the entropy of a sequence S, and pi is the probability (p) of a character
i through each position (n) in S. This allows us to quantify the average relative
information density held within a string of information [117].

3.3.4

Statistics

The null hypothesis of homogeneity of two distributions was examined with the Kolmogorov Smirnov, the Kruskal-Wallis, and the 2-sampled Student’s T-test statistical
tests. These tests were all ran through the Python SciPy stat v0.17 package [220].
To note, the KS test scrutinises for significant maximal absolute differences between
distribution curves; the KW test is after skews between distributions and the student
T-test statistical test checks the average difference between distributions.
Since the P value is a product of a fraction of test statistics obtained from a permutated set of the samples, it exponentially increases as N increases; the P -value is
a strong function of N . We rely on the Bahadur slope (B) as a measure of distance
between two distributions [167, 199–201]. A larger Bahadur slope shows a greater
difference between the two distributions.

B=

| ln(P value)|
N

(3.2)

In the heatmaps (Figure 3.6, Figure 3.7), the relative percentage normalisation was
used rather than a fraction of the absolute value. This aims to answer the question of
“if we have a certain amino acid, which position is it likely to be in?” and are able to
sensitively identify clusters of skewed preference [167].

3.3.5

Modelling Cytochrome b5 and PTP1b

The HHpred web server was used to query homologues of and model templates for
Cytochrome b5 (UniProt accession code P00167) and PTP1b (UniProt accession code
P18031) [272]. Homologues were queried using three iterations of HHblitscd against
the sequence database version uniprot20 2016 02 to generate the query Hidden Markov
Model. The choice of templates was driven by the quality and coverage of the alignments and of the quality of the models that resulted. For cytochrome b5, a multiple
alignment was generated from PDB accession codes 2M33, 2KEO, 3X34, 1MJ4, 1MJ4,
2IBJ covering the globular domain, and PDB accession codes 5NAO, 5DOQ, 5NAM,
and 2MMU covering the TMH. Modeller was run from within the HHPRED server
to generate the homology model [273, 274]. The model was confirmed to be of high
quality using ProSA (Z-Score: -4.61) [275], Ramachandran plot on the RAMPAGE
web server (98% allowed residues, including all TMH residues) [276].
The coverage and alignment quality of PTP1b was, however, not as good quality.
Although UniProt holds 145 associated PDB structures for PTP1b, these structures
cover at least some part of the globular domains of the protein. There are no PDB
structures for the TM domain or the nearby flanking regions. Instead of a global protein model, only the Transmembrane Domain (TMD) was modelled using a homology
model derived from a single sequence alignment of 5NAO based on the TMH±6 (the
length of the C-terminal tail) residues of PTP1b. The ProSA Z-Score was 0.08 which
is well within the acceptable range for proteins of that length [275].
Both these TMH regions were verified by a consensus of sequence TMH predictions (Scampi seq [33], Phobius [32], TMHMM [28], MEMSAT3 [27], TMpred [277],
HMMTOP [29], DAS–TMfilter [179], MINNOU [278], OCTOPUS [31], PRODIV [30],
PRO–S [30], S–TMHMM [30], and proteus [279]). However, it should be noted that
not all these predictions unanimously agreed. For PTP1b, several methods identified

3.4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

113

more than 1 TMH (HMMTOP, TMPred) whilst Memsat identified a short TMH in a
completely different region for the TMH (35A to 45R). Besides that, only S–TMHMM
and PRO agreed on the exact start and stop positions, and it so happens that these
are also the majority consensus positions [280] (409F to 429F).
APBS as a PyMol plugin was used to map the electrostatic surface of the model
[281]. Consurf [282] was used to map the conservation scores based on 5 iterations
of PSI-BLAST [283] with an E-value cut-off of 0.0001. Hydrophobicity was mapped
according to the Eisenberg aggregated hydrophicity scale [111] using a script accessed
at https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Color_h.

Results And Discussion
A Comparison Of Up-To-Date Tail-Anchored Protein
Datasets

Here, we use two sources for TA protein datasets. One dataset is based on a previous
method [224] to obtain TA datasets and consists of 9296 TMH residues (13279 including up to ±5 flanking residues) from 443 SwissProt entries with 90% redundancy
removal. Another dataset contains the UniProt curated set of Type IV membrane proteins again with 90% redundancy removal. This dataset contains 20528 TMH residues
(27950 including up to ±5 flanking residues) from 956 UniProt protein records.
In order to get an understanding of the consistency of the datasets, before removing
redundant proteins, we compared these two datasets to a dataset remapped set of
proteins from a previous 2007 method [224]. The S1 dataset was built with an aim
to gather TA proteins in the human genome from the NCBI. The greatest source
of uncertainty here is that the original S1 list includes 411 records, however, only
222 of these were successfully mapped to the UniProt dataset. This figure is closer
to the 202 proteins from the original S1 list that excluded proteins that were either
hypothetical or splice isoforms. That being said, this mapping step prevents us from
directly comparing the entire original S1 dataset. We compared the up-to-date datasets
to S1 to see how many records are shared, how many are now obsolete, and how many
are unique.

this diagram was generated without the use of CD-HIT [217, 271], which is applied in the later
statistical analysis.

3.4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

115

Figure 3.3 shows that S1 has 175 record ids of 222 records (78.8%) which do not
share overlap the up-to-date manually curated UniProt dataset [36]. Of the 170 unique
records of that S1 dataset, 4 were manually annotated as not belonging to the Homo
sapiens proteome, 20 have the C-terminal as annotated being cytoplasmic, only 125
had TRANSMEM annotation indicating a bona fide TMH. If we apply equivalent filters,
only 42 have annotation verifying that they are TA proteins.

Equivalent criteria to the original Kalbfleisch et al., 2007 [224] study was applied
to the entire SwissProt database and then restricted to the human proteome dataset.
24 of these 47 records (51.1%) are in the curated UniProt TA dataset. 21 of the 49
(44.7%) records from SwissProt filtered Homo sapiens dataset can be found in the
original S1 list.

The same method applied to an up-to-date dataset overlaps more with a manually
curated dataset. There is also a large degree of what we now believe to be mistakes
that occurred in the older prediction tools and datasets, even when using similar
methods. As a trend, this shows that up-to-date datasets improve the reliability of
this automated predicted method. These automated criteria still do not fully align with
the manually curated list. Of 2633 records in the manually curated list, only 2241 have
the TRANSMEM annotation. Further is not only the transmembrane annotation itself but
also the type of transmembrane protein. Small integral membrane protein 1 is a blood
group antigen ( UniProt ID B2RUZ4) that is just one example of a protein we know
to be a post-translationally inserted TA protein, and yet in UniProt it is annotated
as a type II, not type IV, transmembrane protein. As a result of which it appears in
the SwissProt automatically filtered list and not the manually curated list. In an ideal
database, where there are instances of discrepancy, a note on post-translational or cotranslational biogenesis would address this issue. Ultimately, this points to the idea
that datasets are a moving target as they are constantly updated with more accurate
information using evermore reliable tools and methods.

3.4.2

It Is Difficult To Observe Any Hydrophobic Variation
Of TA Protein TMHs From Different Species

In single-pass proteins of eukaryotic species, there are typically various adaptations
of the TMH to adhere to the membrane constraints of the specific membrane. For
single-pass proteins, previous studies have observed differences in terms of TMH hydrophobicity between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens TMPs [48], or in
cress, yeast, bacteria, and Homo sapien datasets [167]. We would expect to see a similar trend between the TMHs of TA proteins from different species. However, when
assuming a zero-difference hypothesis, in these TMH TA protein datasets we cannot
observe any species-level differences between the datasets at this sample size for TMH
hydrophobicity.
When comparing the average Kyte & Doolittle [34] hydrophobicity values for
the TMHs from Homo sapiens and Mus musculus, A. thaliana, and S. cerevisiae, we
can see little difference between the mean values. All of the mean values lie between
2.3-2.6 when we only consider the TMH and at 1.3-1.6 when considering residues in
close proximity to the TMH (±5 residues) (Figure 3.4).
Indeed, we see no strong observable statistical differences in hydrophobicity (P >
3.35E − 1 in the SwissProt automatically filtered list Table 3.1, and P > 2.40E − 1
in the UniProt curated list Table 3.2). There are also no consistent trends among the
absolute Bahadur slopes; no datasets are greatly different from any other.
Table 3.1: Hydrophobicity statistical comparisons between mouse and human, yeast,
and plants in the SwissProt Filtered Dataset. Here, we compare a mammalian set of TA
proteins (Homo sapiens N=46 and Mus musculus N=48) to A. thaliana (N=49) representing plants
and S. cerevisiae (N=24) representing yeasts. The hydrophobicity was predicted as the mean average
of the values of the sequences of the TMH, as well another group including up to ±5 flanking residues,
since predicting the boundary of TMHs is difficult, according to the Kyte & Doolittle hydrophobicity
scale [34]. The Test column refers to the statistical score obtained from the test; H statistic for the
Kruskal Wallis, the KS statistic for the Kolmogorov Smirnov test, and the t-statistic for the T-test.
P is the P-value of that statistical score. B refers to the Bahadur slope, an interpretation of the
P-value that accounts for the sample size powering the test [199, 200].

this only goes to show that if there is a biochemically distinct effect in TA proteins in
terms of hydrophobicity between species, it is indeed weak.

There Are Biochemical Differences Between TailAnchored TMHs From Different Organelles

Although the species datasets appeared to have no significant differences between them
in terms of hydrophobicity, we also investigated the subcellular membranes. We see
clear differences in the biochemistry of the TMH (Figure 3.5).

In the UniProt curated list, there are clear hydrophobic differences between all the
organelle TMH datasets excluding flanks (P < 2.98E − 6) which as a trend becomes
less clear when considering the TMH±5 flanking residues except for mitochondria
which increases in significance when considering the flanks also (Table 3.3). The
ER and mitochondrial tests are very significant (P < 4.22E − 82). Consistently the
Bahadur slope is at least an order of magnitude greater in the ER and mitochondrial
comparison than for the other considerations, so these differences cannot be accounted
for by the larger sample size. This gap in hydrophobicity appears to be due to a
trend of the ER, PM, and Golgi using isoleucine, valine, and leucine as their most

120

CHAPTER 3. COLLATION AND ANALYSIS OF TAIL-ANCHORED...

common TMH residues, whereas in the case mitochondrial located TA proteins, the
most common residue type is alanine in the UniProt manually curated dataset (16.3%
of total residues) followed by valine (12% total residues)(Figure 3.6).
Similarly, alanine is the second most common residue in mitochondrial located TA
proteins from the SwissProt automatically generated dataset at 11.9% of the total
residues after leucine which is 13.4% of the total residues(Figure 3.7).
Analysis from 16 TA proteins with known subcellular locations showed that both
the C-terminal tail charge and hydrophobicity are determinants of the terminal destination to the ER, mitochondria, and the peroxisome intracellular subcellular locations
[269]. They found that less hydrophobicity and more charge in the “tail” determined
the TA protein for the mitochondria rather than the ER. This corroborates what we
see in terms of hydrophobicity (Figure 3.5A). When we consider charge difference between organelles on larger datasets, we see trends that reinforce this idea, however,
rather than net charge, we see charge distribution along the TMH and the neighbouring flanks. In the SwissProt automatically filtered dataset, in the ER 9.4% of the
residues are positively charged, and 2.5% are negatively charged. Most of the positively charged residues cluster following the “positive-inside” rule between positions
-15 and -10 for R and K, but so do the negatively charged residues D and E, effectively
reducing this local charge by 2.5%. In mitochondria, we find that the proportion of
charge is similar (10.4% R and K, 3.3% D and E) however the negatively charged
residues cluster on the N flank (-15 to -8) and the positively charged residues cluster
more strongly on the outside flank (positions 9 to 15) (Figure 3.7).
In the UniProt manually curated ER set, 6.6% of residues are positively charged
and 3.3% of residues are negatively charged. K clusters strongly on the inside flank
as expected, yet R clusters strongly between positions 7 to 15 and rather weakly at
the inside flank (positions -15 to -10) (Figure 3.6). Similarly to the SwissProt sets,
D prefers the inside flank but is tolerated in the outside flank. The more abundant
E residues behave very unusually and cluster at positions 5-10. Generally, charged
residues are suppressed in the TMH core [48, 78], especially in anchoring TMHs [167].
It is unclear why this is observed, yet, altogether the 313 glutamic acid residues and
397 arginine residues that appear unusually deep in the TMH core may be to an
extent neutralising one another in the folded TMH arrangement, but are ultimately

not that abundant compared to the total number of residues in this organelle dataset
(11351 total residues). In mitochondria, 1413 positively charged residues (11% of the
total residues in the mitochondrial dataset) were preferentially located at the outside
flank and somewhat into the core (positions 6 to 15) than the expected “inside” flank
(positions -15 to -5). The 221 negatively charged residues (1.7%) unusually cluster
at the inside. This results in a strong net positive-outside charge signal since there
are more positively charged residues on the outer flank uncountered by the negatively
charged residues, which are skewed with a preference for the inside flank.
Information entropy has been known to identify cryptic function in TMHs when
considered along with hydrophobicity [23, 38]. In terms of information entropy, there
is a marked decrease in entropy in the PM subset (mean entropy = 3.15 in the TMH,
2.67 including ±5 flanking residues) from the UniProt curated dataset compared to
the other organelle datasets (entropy > 3.29 and > 2.85 including the flanks). However, this stark difference between TMHs from PM bound TA proteins and the other
organelle datasets cannot be observed in the SwissProt set (Figure 3.5).
No clear significant differences can be observed for the information entropy (P >
6.33E − 2). This is unsurprising given that the hydrophobic nature of the TMHs demands that certain residues must be over-represented, which lowers the information
entropy. In this case, we have a highly hydrophobic set, the PM UniProt set, which
likely contains a higher proportion of the most hydrophobic residues. As a trend,
the information entropy mirrors the hydrophobicity albeit with less range between
dataset means (2.67-3.15 in the TMH for information entropy, 1.72-2.74 for hydrophobicity)(Figure 3.5).
Similarly, in the SwissProt filtered dataset, the mean TMH hydrophobicity for
mitochondria is the lowest at 1.9, but it appears to be the Golgi apparatus that is the
peak at 2.4. In the SwissProt dataset, when we compare each subset of only the TMH
to the ER subset, we find significance between the ER and the Golgi (P < 1.98E − 3),
and the ER and the mitochondria (P < 4.62E − 3), however, the ER and PM are
more similar considering the Bahadur values are < 6.44E − 4, two orders of magnitude
smaller than the other sets (Bahadur values > 3.3E − 2) (Table 3.4). When we take
into account the flanks, the ER and PM dataset can be distinguished (P < 2.50E − 3),
however, as a trend the other two comparisons, ER and Golgi become less significant,

and ER and mitochondria become more significant.
The information entropy of the TMH string was also examined. No significance
was observed in any consideration of the information entropy, but similarly to the
UniProt subset, as a trend, the entropy mirrors the hydrophobicity (Figure 3.5).
The known lipid asymmetry caused by sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids on the
non-cytosolic leaflet and phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine in the cytosolic leaflet in the Golgi and PM and lack of asymmetry in the ER [209, 210], or that
sphingomyelin is not present in the ER but is present in the Golgi [212] and PM [139,
213]. Furthermore, the PM contains densely packed sphingolipids and sterols [214].
Mitochondria have bacterial lipids in their membrane and uniquely contain cardiolipin
[284], which is also present in the mitochondrial outer membrane [285].
Hydrophobic differences in the have already been observed in the mitochondria localised TA protein TMHs [286]. Here we observe that average biochemical features are
evidently of significance. Furthermore, we see that the typically positive-inside negative outside tandem in positively and negatively charged residues is reversed in the
mitochondria to positive-outside negative-inside. This variation in TMH hydrophobicity and charged residue skew reversal may be yet another nuance of the system which
goes some way to explaining how signals are maintained in local environments even
when the average values are ambiguous. We also identify that alanine is a key reason

3.4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

125

behind the hydrophobic difference between subcellular organelles, with alanine being
highly selected, if not favoured over other hydrophobic residues like leucine, in mitochondrial TA proteins compared to the ER, the Golgi, and the PM. This could be an
adaptation to the mitochondrial membrane, which contains a higher level of cardiolipins than other membranes [58, 285]. Regarding the charged residue distribution, there
should also be a consideration of membrane potential. Although membrane potentials
are in flux, typically, the PM has a potential of 70mV with the negativity being on
the cytoplasmic side. It has been shown that the ER is again between 75-95mV with
negativity on the lumenal side [69, 70]. There is no detectable potential across the
Golgi [72], and the mitochondrial inner membrane has a potential of 150-180 with
negativity on the matrix side [71]. However, whilst those numbers go some way to
satisfy the flanking charge reversal we see, they do not apply to the mitochondrial
outer membrane in which the TA proteins are localised; porins on the mitochondrial
outer membrane effectively diminish the membrane potential across the membrane.
Furthermore, these obseved membrane potential values are by their nature not fixed
values. Not only would this be most striking in the nerve and muscle cells of course,
but also would contrast between resting and stimulated secretory cells.

It has been known for some time that both the charge and the hydrophobic length
of the TA protein TMH region determine subcellular targeting of the protein [286].
The C-terminal tail charge is particularly important for determining subcellular localisation, and can even override the hydrophobic signal if strong enough [269]. Here we
see that while hydrophobicity is statistically different between the subcellular membranes, there is overlap. Whilst there are differences in total average charge at the
C-terminal flank, this is not an absolute rule. Perhaps these TA protein anchors are
similar to that of signal anchored proteins. Signal anchored proteins contain a single hydrophobic segment that serves as both a mitochondrial targeting signal and a
membrane anchor. Signal anchored proteins, along with some TA proteins, have been
shown to be able to spontaneously insert into the membrane independently from the
translocon [20, 262, 287].

Nevertheless, it is tempting to conclude that these biochemical differences between

126

CHAPTER 3. COLLATION AND ANALYSIS OF TAIL-ANCHORED...

localised TA proteins are an adaptation to the membrane composition and environment. But this must be tempered by noting that the spontaneously inserting cytochrome b5 localises to the mitochondrial membrane in the absence of cytosol, and
to the ER in the presence of cytosol [Costa2017]; there are also biological factors
determining localisation.
In summary, the mitochondria located TA protein TMHs typically have a preference for alanine over leucine unlike their secretory counterparts and have a negative-inside positive-outside tendency counter to the overwhelming majority of TMPs. It
is unclear if these features are a biophysical adaptation or part of a biological sorting
process.

3.4.4

More annotation is required to identify chaperone interaction factors of the TMH.

TA proteins known to interact with certain chaperones were acquired by filtering the
interactor partner IDs for chaperones from BioGrid through the redundant versions of
these UniProt manually curated lists and SwissProt automatically generated lists.
Hsp40, Hsc70, SRP54 (both plant and human) returned 0 hits, indicating a lack
of annotation regarding TA proteins with these chaperons probably due to the relatively polar, and non-trivially predictable, TMHs of TA proteins that these chaperones
interact with.
Snd1 has 15 records that were in our TA lists. The average Kyte & Doolittle
hydrophobicity of these records was 2.60 in the TMH itself and 1.58 including ± 5
flanking residues. Sgt2, with 14 records, had a TMH hydrophobicity of 2.47 and 1.51
including the flanks. 5 records were captured for SGTA with a TMH hydrophobicity of
2.27 and 1.19 including the flanks. TRC40 had the highest TMH hydrophicity of 2.77
and 1.82 including flanks. However, TRC40 also only had 7 records. Get3 had 22 TA
interactor records with an average TMH hydrophobicity of 2.36 and 1.48 including the
flanks. The 2 records for human Pex19 had an average hydrophobicity of 1.33 for the
TMH and 0.70 including the flanking residues. The yeast Pex19 had a TMH average
hydrophobicity of 2.48 and 1.41 including the flanking residues. The 4 yeast SRP54
interactors had an average TMH of 2.43 and 1.98 including the flanking residues.

3.4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

127

At the time of the investigation, these sample sizes are not statistically viable
for analysis. Whilst it appears TRC40 interactors have notably hydrophobic TMHs,
TRC40s yeast homologue Get3 has interactors with much more polar TMHs, yet SGTA
was lower than SGT2 on average. So although these average values differ and overlap
between various chaperone systems, we tried to identify clearer patterns from the TMH
hydrophobic profiles (Figure 3.8). Similarly, whilst a clear dip in hydrophobicity at
position +5 in Get3 from 2-3 across the rest of the TMH core to 0.32, there is no such
spike for TRC40 meaning this is probably not of any functional importance, but rather
an artefact of overrepresented proteins in the Get3 dataset. Snd1 also lies among these
values, reinforcing Snd1 as a biological redundancy system [229, 230, 237].

As expected, the human Pex19 interactors are as a trend among the most polar
throughout the TMH core, however, when we consider the yeast Pex19, this trend is
less clear.

At least at a handful of locations (-3, 3, 4 and 5) the SRP54 interactors have the
most hydrophobic TMH cores.

TRC40 has the highest TMH hydrophobicities at 3.9 at position -1, however, the
yeast homologue Get3 doesn’t appear to have any preference for especially hydrophobic
TMHs.

In order to remove redundant proteins and investigate this further, more records
with greater levels of accurate annotation need to be available to both BioGrid and
UniProt. We also observe a great deal of overlap between the profiles, indicating that
as a trend this is more complex than hydrophobicity alone, or at least polarity is not
the absolute determinant of subcellular targeting. Hydrophobicity alone would have
resulted in stark contrasts between chaperone interactor pairs, even with low sample
sizes.

However, this method demonstrates a potential way that this chaperone-interaction
problem can be investigated to verify that indeed hydrophicity plays a deterministic
role in chaperone selection.

Spontaneous Insertion May Be Achieved by Polar
Strips in the TMH of Tail-Anchored Proteins

The TMHs of cytochrome b5 and PTP1b are among the least hydrophobic of the TA
proteins and in theory misses the ∆G requirements of a TMH due to their relatively
polar TMHs [228, 229]. Indeed the TMH is so polar that it is not trivial to predict
and is not found in either dataset prepared herein. Structural modelling and analysis
thereof reveal features that may explain the “missing hydrophobicity” [35, 84, 207,
208] of these particular TMHs.
The electrostatic surfaces are prototypical of a TMH anchor with large “positive-inside” patches [48, 78, 79, 82, 83, 167] and a strong “negative-outside” charge
[167](Figure 3.9C). Once in the membrane, this may allow it to be an effective anchor despite such poor hydrophobicity since it satisfies electrostatic coupling to the
membrane potential.
Furthermore, there is the question of overcoming the unfavourable interaction most
TMHs would face when coming into contact with the highly polar membrane interface.
We observe a highly conserved strip of relatively polar / non-hydrophobic residues
on one side of the TMH core (in cytochrome b5 these are N112, P116, A120, A124
Y127, and R128). Similarly, a polar face exists for the PTP1b TMH (R430, N434,

3.4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

129

Y426, T422, and T419). These polar faces would not be as repulsed by the interfacial
environment as either a more hydrophobic TMH or an equally hydrophobic TMH with
a different sequence and structure order (Figure 3.9 and Figure 3.10). Scrambling the
cytochrome b5 TMH sequence whilst maintaining the same hydrophobicity (DSNSS
W W T N W V I P A I S A L I V A L M YR to DSNSS W W A S A I I A T
M I P L L V N V W YR) reduces the insertion potential [105]; there is more to it
than hydrophobicity alone. It becomes apparent that the 3D arrangement of these
relatively polar TMH residues is conserved and is probably the key to spontaneous
insertion of TMHs.

We speculate that this polar face allows the unassisted approach to the membrane’s polar phospholipid head groups, and once in sufficiently close proximity, the

hydrophobic side of the helix is entropically driven by the water environment into the
membrane (Figure 3.11). This close proximity is less likely to be achieved if there is
no side of the TMH to favourably interact with the lipid head groups, even though
average hydrophobicity could be similar. Once integrated, the TMH charged flanking
regions help sustain integration in lieu of a more hydrophobic TMH core.

as the teal TMH, by having a more hydrophobic side (blue), and a more polar side (green), the TA
protein now has a TMH surface that may interact more favourably with the interfacial region. Once
interacting with the membrane sufficiently close to the interfacial region, the hydrophobic face is still
being entropically driven by water molecules from the cytosol, which would lead to partitioning into
the membrane. Once integrated, the strong “positive-inside” “negative-outside” charges on the TMH
flanks compensate for the lack of hydrophobicity in the core of the TMH.

3.5

Summary

Here, we have observed a large biochemical distinction between TA proteins with
different terminal subcellular destinations. Previously it was known that both hydrophobicity and charge are involved in targeting [269]. In this study, we find that the
location of the charge along and around the TMH differs among subcellular compartments. Crucially, there is a shift in the charged residue inside-outside tandem in the
TMH flanking residues in different organelles. In the secretory pathway, the “positive-inside” “negative-outside” skew adheres to the membrane-potential for electrostatic
coupling, but in the mitochondrial outer membrane where there is no membrane potential, positively charged residues are skewed outside the cytoplasm, and the negatively
charged residues are preferentially found inside the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the missing hydrophobicity of mitochondrial TA proteins can be in part attributed to the high
abundance of alanine rather than leucine or isoleucine in the TMH; it is not solely the

132

CHAPTER 3. COLLATION AND ANALYSIS OF TAIL-ANCHORED...

tolerance of polar residues in the TMH. We expected to see evolutionary adaptations of
TMH hydrophobicity to species-specific membranes, even within eukaryotes [48, 167].
In this study using both a manually curated dataset from UniProt and an automatically filtered list using SwissProt annotation, we do not observe any strong differences.
Since we could not scrutinise a difference in the species, the strong hydrophobic differences between organelle TMHs are indicative of a stronger adaptation pressure than
between species as a whole. These differences are likely to be partially adaptations to
the organelle location membrane type and also possible cryptic biological factors that
play a role in their targeting via chaperone-binding affinity. This could be a functional
similarity to the signal-anchored proteins.
We could not find any clear trends or perform statistical work on the interactor
datasets due to the small sample sizes, however, as the databases are enriched, this
same method will be able to answer the questions about chaperone affinity with more
accuracy in the future.
Furthermore, the spontaneously inserting TA proteins PTP1b and cytochrome b5
appear to share a polar face that emerges in structural models and a strong “positive-inside” “negative-outside” electrostatic surface. The polar face may be responsible
for the promotion insertion potential in the absence of insertion proteins since when
the sequence is scrambled, the insertion potential is reduced [105]. The positively and
negatively charged residues are distributed like an ideal anchoring TMH [167] which
could allow the marginally hydrophobic TMH to perform as a suitable membrane
anchoring feature.

Abstract

Marginally hydrophobic transmembrane helices perform a variety of essential for life
intra-membrane molecular biochemistry. However, due to their relatively polar composition, they often lack sufficient hydrophobicity by themselves to incorporate into
the membrane efficiently via the translocon. Other elements of the sequence context,
such as other transmembrane helices or flexible loop regions, allow the marginally hydrophobic transmembrane regions to integrate into the membrane environment. Here
we analyse large numbers of multipass transmembrane protein sequences stratified by
protein families and molecular functions to show that there are conserved stark differences between sequentially adjacent transmembrane helices in terms of hydrophobicity
and TMSOC complexity. Not all classes of transmembrane protein have these highly
polar-hydrophobic pairs. In the instances of GPCRs and ion channels, there is evidence in the literature to support cooperative insertion between the these highly polar-hydrophobic transmembrane helix pairs highlighted in our results. We propose that
such methods may be used to identify other examples of undocumented cooperative
transmembrane helix insertion into the membrane.

CHAPTER 4. COOPERATION BETWEEN TMHS...

Introduction

Translocation is the process of incorporating a TMP into the membrane. A ribosome translates the Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) to a nascent peptide chain which is
handed directly (co-translational insertion) or indirectly (post-translational insertion)
to the translocon insertion machinery. This translocon assembly then threads the
chain through the membrane and releases hydrophobic TMHs into the membrane environment.
The overwhelming majority of TMPs use the co-translational method of translocation. It has long been understood that this method is essentially the SRP recognising
and attaching to the nascent peptide chain whilst it is still associated with the ribosome, and the SRP then targets the peptide and ribosome to an SR in association
with the membrane insertion machinery on the ER membrane [84, 288].
Crystal structures showed the SRP targets the nascent peptide chain for membrane
insertion via a GTPase in both the SRP and SR, that is initially associated with the
translocon machinery, coming together to form a complex thus bringing the nascent
peptide chain in proximity to the translocon [289]. Mutant studies of SRP revealed
key discrete conformational stages [289]. These are the specific recognition of signal
sequences on cargo proteins, the targeting of the package to the membrane, the handing
over of the cargo to the translocation machinery all the while maintaining precise
spatial and temporal coordination of each molecular event [290].
The prevailing idea about membrane insertion by the translocon is that the TMHs
partition in the membrane one at a time as the translocon lateral gate opens, exposing
the TMH to the membrane (Figure 4.1)[19].

4.2.1

The ribosome-translocon complex in the biogenesis of
membrane proteins.

Ribosomes translate mRNA sequences into amino acid chains and are present in all
living cells, and indeed the ribosomal complexes presence and activity is, for many,
used to define whether something is alive. They are a highly conserved RNA-protein
complex with a multitude of accessory proteins and targetting factors.

Figure 4.1: A cartoon showing the generally accepted schematic of sequential multipass
TMH insertion into the membranes. The two key concepts are that one at a time, the TMHs
emerge from the ribosome into the translocon. This appearance of hydrophobicity triggers the lateral gate to open. As the nascent TMH is exposed to the membrane, it begins to partition. The
downstream protein from the TMH is then threaded through the translocon until the next TMH is
recognised. This implies that the TMHs ultimately have no meaningful interactions with one another
until the protein has been threaded into the membrane and the multiple TMHs form a bundle.

During translation of a TMP protein, the SRP binds to the ribosome after recognising the nascent protein as a TMP. This complex then binds to the SR in association
with the membrane-bound translocon. The nascent peptide is then fed into the translocon as it is being translated; hence “co-translational insertion”. The journey of the
TMH through this machinery has been studied using both cross-linking experiments
and the relatively new technique of Arrest Peptide (AP)s [19].
APs are typically 10-15 residues long that bind to the upper end of the ribosomal
exit tunnel. Once a specific mRNA codon is recognised, ribosomal stalling is induced
[293] and the translation is halted unless a strong enough pulling force from the downstream insertion is acting on the nascent chain at that time [294]. Several “strengths”
of AP have been identified. For example, SecM from E. coli is 17 residues long and relatively weak, whereas a mutated SecM from Mannheimia succiniciproducens(Ms-Sup1)
is much stronger and 8 residues long ending in a proline which will halt translation
[193]. There are several other SecM proteins of other strengths from various bacterial
species [295]. Therefore APs are a technique that can be used to measure precise
forces acting on a specific part of the nascent chain during co-translational membrane
protein integration allowing the study of TMP kinetics during insertion and folding.
Indeed the force profile of a single residue can now be obtained in vivo [193]. In an
idealised TMH segment composed of alanine and leucine being inserted into E. coli

The structure used is of a translating mammalian ribosome-Sec61 translocon complex (PDB code
3j7r [125]). The Sec61 translocon is the membrane-embedded element of the structure that feeds
the protein into the membrane. The ribosome is made of two elements; 60s and 40s. These vary in
composition and size between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. PTC refers to the peptidase transferase
centre, a high conserved catalytic site across all the kingdoms of life that performs the translation of
RNA to amino acid polypeptides. After translation, the nascent peptide moves down the exit tunnel
located in the larger ribosomal subunit. There is evidence that the secondary structural elements of
TMHs in ion channels are pre-folded in the ribosomal exit tunnel [Lu2005. Tu2010a, 291, 292]. The
ribosome hands the nascent chain to the translocon. Once the plug moves to expose the translocon
pore, the translocon has a hydrophobic core which regulates the integration of the TMH via the
lateral gate [95].

membrane through SecM AP with SDS-PAGE, hydrophobicity is more able to overcome the arrest peptide when it is near the N-terminal (of an N-terminal-inside TMH)
[193]. This could be either the TMH finally coming into contact with the cytoplasmic
face of the lipid bilayer, or an interaction between the N-terminal and the tip of the
lateral gate as previously shown in Sec61; part of a pre-integration TMH interrogation
[296].
The ribosome passes the nascent chain to the Sec translocon machinery. Like

4.2. INTRODUCTION

137

the ribosome, the Sec pathway is widely conserved across life [119]. Sec61 (in eukaryotes) and SecYEG (in prokaryotes) translocate hydrophilic peptides across a
membrane whilst also integrating sufficiently hydrophobic sequences to the membrane [Rapoport2012, Shao2011, 19, 95]. SecY in prokaryotes or Sec61α in eukaryotes are TMPs with 10 TMHs that perform the translocation. These proteins
have a lumenal plug [127, 128] and a constricted core to prevent permeability whilst
the protein is idle [95]. During translocation the plug moves out of the pore [297], the
channel is in an open unconstricted state [95], and a lateral gate of TMH2 and TMH7
[Berg] periodically opens to release a TMH to the membrane environment if sufficient
hydrophobicity is detected in the peptide chain [95, 136](Figure 4.1).

Early evidence of secondary structure folding of the Kv ion channel showed that the S6
(referred to later in this study as TMH6) is indeed compacted in the ribosomal tunnel
by using pegylation and calmodulation of the tagged cysteine-scanned S6 transmembrane segment [298]. Furthermore, accessibility assays and an improved intramolecular
cross-linking assay showed that the helical transmembrane S3bS4 hairpin (the paddle)
of a voltage-gated potassium (Kv) forms in the ribosome tunnel [291]. Ribosomal
folding of the TMHs in Kv1.3, a potassium channel, is maintained in the translocon
[299]. Therefore, some of the final structural folding of the voltage sensor domain
occur within the ribosomal exit tunnel.
Furthermore, it has recently been suggested that larger structures fold as the ribosomal exit tunnel widens [292]. This size-dependent folding was observed by using the
SecM translational AP. Two ribosome mutants were compared (uL23 that is close to
the exit tunnel and uL24 deletions which is a hairpin loop that obstructs the tunnel
exit.) zinc finger folds deeper in uL23 mutant than wildtype (but not uL24) and a 100
residue domain folds deeper than the uL24 mutant (but not the uL23) [292].
The ribosomal tunnel also speeds up elongation of neutral and negatively-charged
peptides. This is attributed to the sporadic negative patches within the ribosomal exit
tunnel [300].

138

CHAPTER 4. COOPERATION BETWEEN TMHS...

The ribosome clearly has the potential to pre-fold secondary structures and some
motifs before translocon insertion into the membrane.

Multiple TMHs in a nascent protein can be associated with the eukaryotic translocon simultaneously. It was shown that TMHs can stay in association with the translocon in order to mediate integration of downstream TMHs demonstrated by cross-linking analysis [301, 302]. Not only this, but it was shown that there is a direct
interaction between the TMHs; more recently APs were used to show pulling forces
between a TMH and more C-terminally located TMH during the C-terminal TMH
membrane partitioning from the translocon in vivo [303]. This could be facilitated
during the probing of a TMH from the translocon as the lateral gate “cracks” open in
an intermediate stage before the TMH satisfies the full hydrophobic requirements to
open the gate fully, an intermediate stage observed in a SecY crystal structure [136].

16 marginally hydrophobic TMHs were screened and revealed that independently
they did not efficiently insert via the translocon into the ER [Hedin2009]. The study
showed that in the presence of the neighbouring loops and TMHs, insertion often
became sufficient with the exception of two of the marginally hydrophobic TMHs.
The orientational preference of neighbouring TMHs was shown to increase insertion
efficiency into the ER of a marginally hydrophobic TMH [jemalm2012]. A glycosylation study of three relatively polar TMHs revealed that proteins have even evolved
to exhibit stronger “positive-inside” tendencies when following another TMH [304].
Subsequent TMHs with a strong topological preference (increased arginine presence)
increase the insertion potential of relatively polar TMHs, however, no specific interaction between the TMHs was responsible. The nascent polypeptide in the cavity
between the ribosome and the translocon can alter the hydrophobic threshold of the
translocon is dynamic and influenced by downstream flexible sequences [305]. Sequence context is clearly an important factor of the efficient insertion of marginally
hydrophobic TMHs; these TMHs rely on other components of their protein in order
to incorporate into the membrane.

Membrane protein families
This is not an exhaustive search among TMPs for all examples of starkly polar TMHs
conserved among the family. Instead, we show that there is a precedent for several,
but not all, protein families to contain polar helices and that these polar TMHs are
sequentially next to typically hydrophobic TMHs. Analysis can only be done if the
number of TMHs is conserved across the family since different mechanisms are utilised
to transmit a signal or transport a molecule across the membrane.
Datasets were attained by querying the UniProt database for controlled vocabulary
keywords (Table 4.1) [36]. After filtering out redundant proteins using UniRef50, the
datasets were stratified according to the total number of TMHs per protein. Only
families with a total N >20 were included in the analysis, for example, there are ion
channels with 12 TMHs, but only 16 examples fitted the criteria and were omitted
from the study.

GPCR subfamilies
The 7TMR list is a list distributed by UniProt containing GPCRs available at
http://www.uniprot.org/docs/7tmrlist.txt [36]. The entire list contains 3115
UniProt IDs which mapped to 3092 records on the date of download (12/9/2017).
After removing redundant records using UniRef50 to identify cluster representatives,
1142 records made the final dataset. The original list is also sub categorised by function. Here, we also looked at opsins, the T2R taste receptors, frizzled/smooth GPCRs,
metabotropic glutamate receptors (Family C), and fungal mating proteins.
218 opsin records were mapped through UniRef50 to 40 records. 211 T2R taste
receptors were mapped to 45 records after UniRef50. There were 82 records for frizzled/smooth, of which 41 were cluster representatives after querying with UniRef50.
114 were metabotropic glutamate receptors which became 44 after redundancy removal. In serotonin, 91 original records were represented by 28 records. There were 13
fungal mating proteins, represented by 9 after UniRef50. 560 olfactory records were
mapped to 274 records after Uniref50.
After limiting all these sets to records containing 7 TRANSMEM features, there
were 39 opsins, 38 frizzled smooth GPCRs, 9 fungal mating GPCRs, 41 metabolic
glutamate receptors, 45 t2r taste receptor proteins, and 263 olfactory receptor GPCR
proteins. TRANSMEM is an annotation by UniProt denoting a TMH evidenced by

Complexity and hydrophobic estimation

Primarily we used the Kyte & Doolittle scale in this work [34]. We verified this
scale with the Eisenberg scale [111], the Hessa biological scale [84], and the White and
Wimley scale [106]. The Eisenberg scale is potentially double counted for many of these
proteins since it is used by UniProt during their automatic TMH annotation where
experimental evidence is not available. The Hessa biological scale originally reported
positional dependencies that affected the hydrophobicity values which were refined in
a later version of the scale [35], however, this later version was not programmatically
available to us.
When stratifying TMHs by hydrophobicity and sequence information entropy, there
is a clear distinction between anchoring TMHs and those with a function beyond anchoring. The TMSOC z-score quantifies this relationship and is calculated by equation

Statistics

We used the Welch’s t-test to scrutinise the means of the datasets without assuming
equal variance. To examine any differences in the skew of the datasets, the Kruskal
Walis, and the Kolmogorov Smirnov tests were used. All these tests were performed
using the Python scipy package [307].

Results and discussion

4.4.1

Large contrasts in TMH hydrophobicity occurs in channels and receptors.

In order to identify which type of TMP may contain potentially cooperative TMHs,
the hydrophobicities for TMHs from 30045 records in a non-redundant version of
SwissProt were calculated according to the Kyte & Dolittle hydropathy scale [34].
The absolute difference between each sequentially adjacent TMH was calculated. The
full list, along with the 0.1% TMH pair were submitted to PANTHER [306]. We
found that transporters were by far the most abundant in this sub-list relative to the
global TMP list, however, it should be considered that “transporters” in this sense
also includes both ion transporters and ion channels (Figure 4.3). Among the other
prevalent functions are receptors, binding proteins, and signal transducers. All these
lists were predominantly made up of GPCRs.

of binding TMPs stay roughly the same, receptors and signal transducers reduce slightly, catalytic
proteins are reduced by two thirds and transporter more than doubles in proportion.

Since catalytic function decreased so much, as a trend we thought that the catalytic
function of the TMP may not be associated with a high hydrophobic discrepancy
between TMHs within the protein. This gives us an idea of search space where highly

polar TMHs are proximally adjacent to typically hydrophobic TMHs; GPCRs and
membrane transporters.

4.4.2

GPCRs contain conserved relatively polar TMH7,
which follows the typically hydrophobic TMH6

GPCRs are a diverse family of membrane surface receptors with 7 TMH segments.
GPCRs have long been known to be overrepresented among genomes [308]. They have
adapted to respond to a wide range of specific signals ranging from macromolecules
to photons. The specific signal triggers a conformational change of the GPCR that
is translated across the membrane. GPCRs have been associated with tumorigenesis
[309], metastasis [310] and in cancers [311] and are a potential target for therapies
[312]. Their ubiquitous presence in cellular life and medical relevance makes them an
important topic of study.
Here, we structurally aligned 7 structures of monomeric GPCRs using PyMol [313];
PDB codes 1u19 (rhodopsin) [314], 2z73 (rhodopsin) [315], 2vt4 (β1-adrenergic receptor) [316], 2lnl (CXCR1, rhodopsin-like) [132], 4mbs (CCR5, chemokine receptor)
[317], 4xt1 (viral chemokine) [318], and 4ea3 (opioid receptor) [319] (Figure 4.4A).
Even in a relatively small dataset of functionally varied GPCRs, we can see structural conservation of the TMH arrangement (Figure 4.4A Figure 4.4C). Hydrophobic
patterns are hard to identify structurally beyond the clear membrane boundary where
we would expect to see hydrophobic residues in the TMH (Figure 4.4B). TMSOC [23,
38] is an algorithm that takes into account the White and Wimley hydrophobicity
[106] and the information entropy of the TMH sequence. The resulting z-score has
been shown to be able to scrutinise between TMHs that serve as anchors and those
that have a function beyond TMP anchoring. The lower the z-score (low sequence
information entropy and high hydrophobicity), the more likelihood of the TMH being
solely a membrane anchor. When considering the functional/anchoring potential of
these GPCR TMHs using TMSOC, we see trends among the structures with an average of 1.96 for TMH1, 2.30 for TMH2, 2.43 for TMH3, 2.34 for TMH4, 2.05 for TMH5,
2.24 for TMH 6 and 2.83 for TMH7 (Figure 4.4D). TMH3 and TMH7 are therefor the
most likely to contain function beyond anchorage, whilst the low z-scores of TMH1

and TMH5 indicate they are more optimal anchors [167].
When we consider much larger sequence datasets containing 1016 TMHs at each
TMH number from non-redundant GPCRs obtained from UniProt, the trend remains
the same: that TMH3 (mean z-score of 2.52) and TMH7 (mean z-score of 2.55) have the

4.4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

145

highest z-score, whilst TMH1 (mean z-score of 2.09) and TMH5 (mean z-score of 2.20)
have the lowest (Figure 4.4E). To investigate the statistical differences between the zscore of the TMHs, we applied the Kruskal Wallis and 2-sample Kolmogorov Smirnov
tests from each TMH number to each other TMH number. TMH5 and TMH7 are
statistically significantly distinct in terms of TMSOC z-score (Welch’s t-test P-value
= 1.57E-146, Kruskal Wallis P-value = 1.66E-132, Kolmogorov Smirnov P-value =
1.38E-105) as are TMH6 and TMH7 (P-value = 1.48E-51, Kruskal Wallis P-value =
4.96E-52, Kolmogorov Smirnov P-value = 1.74E-37). This is also mirrored in the
relationship between the preceding TMHs of TMH3. TMH1 and TMH3 are distinct
(Welch’s t-test P-value = 3.12E-229, Kruskal Wallis P-value = 1.06E-192, Kolmogorov
Smirnov P-value = 1.06E-174) and so are TMH2 and TMH3 (Welch’s t-test P-value =
3.66E-39, Kruskal Wallis P-value = 2.70E-36, Kolmogorov Smirnov P-value = 1.06E-31). We also find it difficult to observe any significant differences between TMH2
and TMH6 (Welch’s t-test P-value >0.99, Kruskal Wallis P-value = 0.99, Kolmogorov
Smirnov P-value = 0.07).
As expected, these trends are mirrored in the Kyte & Doolittle [34] hydrophobicity
plots. Where there is a high TMSOC z-score, there is a low hydrophobicity score.
However, whereas TMH6 (mean hydrophobicity = 1.69) to TMH7 (mean hydrophobicity = 1.13) are very different (Welch’s t-test P-value = 3.95E-163), the difference
between TMH2 (mean hydrophobicity = 1.42) and TMH3 (mean hydrophobicity =
1.39) is less stark (Welch’s t-test P-value = 0.12). Even though there is a discrepancy between the scales, the significant change in hydrophobicity between TMH6 and
TMH7 can be seen consistently across the Eisenberg consensus scale [111] (Welch’s
t-test P-value = 5.61E-130), the White and Wimley biophysical scale [106] (Welch’s
t-test P-value = 5.21E-62), and the von Heijne/Hessa biological scale [84] (Welch’s
t-test P-value = 3.56E-210) emphasising the significance of this particular TMH pair
(Figure 4.5).
In order to determine if this is conserved through the GPCR subfamilies, a variety of GPCRs with different functions were examined in terms of Kyte & Doolittle
hydrophobicity. When considering different GPCR subfamilies, we see a consistent
difference between hydrophobicities between TMH6 and TMH7 besides metabolic glutamate GPCRs (Welch’s t-test P-value = 0.90) and Frizzled-smooth GPCRs (Welch’s

t-test P-value = 0.07) in which there is only a little discrepancy (Figure 4.6). For
opsins, Welch’s t-test P-value is 5.62E-15. After restricting the dataset to only those
records with 7 TMHs, fungal mating GPCRs were reduced to a set of 9 proteins,
however as a trend, they appear to be very typical GPCRs in terms of TMH hydrophobicity. They follow a very similar pattern to the much more popular olfactory
GPCRs (N=263) for which the TMH6 to TMH7 Welch’s t-test P-value was 4.73E-35.
For taste receptors, there are much bigger step changes between sequentially adjacent
TMHs than between TMH6 to TMH7. But there is still a real statistical difference
between TMH6 and TMH7 (Welch’s t-test P-value = 2.89E-12).
Opsins are a group of light-sensitive GPCRs that exhibit the TMH6-TMH7 hydrophobic discrepancy (Figure 4.6A). It was shown by cross-linking studies that opsin
TMHs 5-7 are retained in the ER translocon and only partition into the membrane

once biosynthesis is complete [320]. The timing of this partitioning is controlled by the
hydrophobicity of the TMH, not protein length or the relative position of the TMH
within the protein. Although artificially extending the C-terminal did not result in
the release of the TMHs, by replacing native TMH7 with a more hydrophobic TMH,
the speed of insertion was decreased. TMHs 1-4 are inserted independently, and the

148

CHAPTER 4. COOPERATION BETWEEN TMHS...

5-7 TMHs partition into the membrane at the same time.
Since lowering the difference in hydrophobicity between TMH6 and TMH7 impedes
efficient insertion of the GPCR [320], that one would expect the terminal TMH to
be more hydrophobic rather than relatively polar [304], and that this hydrophobic
difference is high conserved throughout GPCRs generally (Figure 4.4F), and especially
in many of the subfamilies(Figure 4.6A, C, D, F), we believe that the hydrophobic
difference of TMH6 and TMH7 is highly important to the biogenesis of GPCRs. This is
evidence for widespread biologically employed TMH cooperation during translocation
of a typically hydrophobic TMH remaining in association with the translocon until
the relatively polar TMH is processed by the insertion machinery.

4.4.3

6TMH ion channels contain polar-hydrophobic TMH
pairs/groups indicative of conserved cooperative insertion

Another group of proteins that featured heavily on the list of top TMH pairs with a
high hydrophobic discrepancy was ion channels (Figure 4.3B). Ion channels are a much
more structurally varied class of TMP than GPCRs, varying greatly in their number
of TMHs, so a summary structural alignment equivalent to Figure 4.4A, B, and C was
not possible.
Voltage-gated ion channels are another example of cooperative TMH insertion.
The 3rd and 4th TMH of the potassium channel (shaker family) has been shown
to insert either sequentially or cooperatively [19, 321]. This is especially notable
in the case of KAT1, that is a plant Kv channel that is thought to mediate longterm potassium influx into guard cells causing the stomata to open. In the case
of KAT1, N-glycosylation of various mutant fusion KAT1 constructs revealed that
there is no choice of sequential insertion since TMH3 and TMH4 have no insertion
potential and no topogenic functions themselves [322, 323]. In TMH4 this is due to
the charged residues making it relatively polar. However, previous experimentation
in Kv1.3 had found that while TMH4 did not initiate insertion, it did have insertion
potential and that when constructs contained multiple TMHs, membrane insertion
efficiency increased [324]. Without the ability to stop the translation through the

4.4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

149

translocon and form a TMH, it was suggested that a different means was needed than
classic sequential insertion, and even that TMH3 and TMH4 are integrated by the
translocon at the same time post-translationally, i.e the TMHs are folded prior to
insertion [323]. They achieve this in part because the previous TMHs, TMH1 and
TMH2, form a firm “base” within the membrane environment.
In the 6TMH class of ion channels, we observe a conserved difference in the relatively polar TMH4 known to carry charged residues (Figure 4.7A). When using the
Kyte & Doolittle hydrophobic scale, the hydrophobic step change between TMH3
(mean hydrophobicity of 1.34) and TMH4 (mean hydrophobicity of 1.01) is statistically significantly different (Welch’s t-test P-value = 1.83E-8). This is the most significant step change besides TMH4 to TMH5 (mean hydrophobicity of 1.77, Welch’s
t-test P-value = 1.88E-31). TMH5, the pore-forming region, and TMH6 can be integrated independently into the membrane, but TMH3 and TMH4, at least in the case
of KAT1, cannot [322]. However, there is strong evidence that TMH3 and TMH4
cooperate with one another during membrane integration and are inserted at the same
time [19, 321–323]. This leads us to be inclined to believe that the hydrophobic gap
here that indicates a conserved cooperative role between TMHs is that between TMH3
and TMH4 rather than TMH4 and TMH5.
This statistical difference between the hydrophobicity of TMH3 and TMH4 holds
true for voltage-gated ion channels (Welch’s t-test P-value = 1.57E-17) (Figure 4.7C).
However, the pattern is more obscure in ligand-gated ion channels (Welch’s t-test Pvalue = 5.32E-2). The difference does appear to match the general pattern, however,
albeit as a trend, in the 33 records; there is a decrease in the mean hydrophobicity
from 1.31 to 1.03 (Figure 4.7D).
The TMH3 TMH4 hydrophobic step also appears to be independent of the ion
being transported. For calcium ion channels the drop from TMH3 (mean hydrophobicity 1.52) to TMH3 (mean hydrophobicity 1.21) is significant (Welch’s t-test P-value
= 3.57E-3) given the relatively low sample size (38 protein records) (Figure 4.7E). In
potassium channels, the difference is even greater between TMH3 (mean hydrophobicity of 1.37) and TMH4 (mean hydrophobicity of 0.61) (Welch’s t-test P-value =
2.52E-19) in potassium ion channels (Figure 4.7F).
The observed difference between TMH3 and TMH4 is somewhat independent of

the scale chosen (Figure 4.8), however, the Kyte & Doolittle scale is the most sensitive
to the hydrophobic differences between TMH3 and TMH4. Statistical significance was
found in the difference between TMH3 and TMH4 in the Eisenberg scale (Welch’s t-test
P-value = 4.74E-23), the White and Wimley scale (Welch’s t-test P-value = 1.26E3). The Hessa/von Heijne biological scale was particularly insensitive to the mean
difference (Welch’s t-test P-value = 7.56E-2), but can scrutinise some difference in the
skews of the data (Kolmogorov Smirnov test P-value = 1.56E-4, Kruskal Wallis P-value
= 4.00E-2) indicating that whilst biophysically the TMHs are distinct, the translocon
may not readily scrutinise the hydrophobicity between the two. All the scales however
corroborate the large hydrophobic difference between TMH4 and TMH5 (Welch’s t-test P-values for Hessa = 1.23E-35, White and Wimley = 4.82E-23, Eisenberg =

CHAPTER 4. COOPERATION BETWEEN TMHS...

24TMH class is essentially a modular variant of the 6TMH class, and has even
more extreme discrepencies between the equivalent 4 TMHs (Figure 4.7B). In the
first cluster, TMH3 (mean Kyte & Doolittle hydrophobicity = 0.96) to TMH4 (mean
hydrophobicity = 0.47) is different (Welch’s t-test P-value = 5.16E-6), but even more
so is the step up from TMH4 to TMH5 (hydrophobicity = 2.26, Welch’s t-test P-value = 5.16E-32). The preceding step is weaker, and the proceeding step is greater
throughout the 6TMH “modules”. A similar step change is found between TMH9 and
TMH10 (P-value = 3.02E-13) and TMH10 to TMH11 (P-value = 5.51E-44), TMH15
to TMH16 (P-value = 1.79E-23), TMH16 to TMH17 (P-value = 1.67E-27), TMH21
to TMH22 (P-value = 1.64E-9), and TMH22 to TMH23 (P-value = 3.42E-31).
Oddly, as a trend, the TMSOC z-score was not sensitive to detecting function in
the extremely hydrophobic TMH4 (Figure 4.9). This is due to the other component
of the z-score, the sequence information entropy [23, 38]. The relative probability of a
polar/charged residue is so high in TMH4 that it apparently has the same expectancy
as the hydrophobic residues, and the “simple” entropy mutes somewhat the effect of
the extreme hydrophobicity. This is compounded by the fact that the White and
Wimley scale (used to generate the z-score) is already less sensitive to the relative
polarity difference between TMH3 and TMH4 than the Kyte & Doolittle scale (Figure
4.7A, Figure 4.8A).

153

The prevalance of the high hydrophobic discrepancy
of TMHs amongst other common “transporter” TMP
classes.

Whilst the gene ontology recognises “transporters” as having disproportionately more
highly different hydrophobic sequential pairs, the list is predominantly ion channels,
which are molecularly and functionally different from ion transporters. It also appears
that ion transporters have no conserved hydrophobicity discrepancy between any of
their TMHs for the 4TMH, 6TMH, 8TMH, or 10TMH classes (Figure 4.10 C, D, E,
F, G).
Another large family of transporters are the sugar transporters. In terms of the
hydrophobic discrepancy between sequentially adjacent TMH pairs, sugar transporters
also have a few peaks and dips at TMH6 and TMH11 (Figure 4.10A). TMH5 (mean
hydrophobicity = 1.32) to TMH6 (mean hydrophobicity = 1.81) (Welch’s t-test Pvalue = 3.09E-19) was less significant than TMH6 to TMH7 (mean hydrophobicity =
1.23) (Welch’s t-test P-value = 8.75E-29). TMH10 (mean hydrophobicity = 1.66) to
TMH11 (mean hydrophobicity = 1.23) (Welch’s t-test P-value = 1.03E-14) was also
less significant than TMH11 to TMH12 (mean hydrophobicity = 1.84) (Welch’s t-test
P-value = 3.22E-22).
The ion channel 4TMH class also has a discrepancy between TMH2 (Kyte & Doolittle hydrophobicity = 1.49) and TMH3 (hydrophobicity = 1.81) (Welch’s t-test P- value
= 4.42E-10, from 234 records) (Figure 4.10C). The largest family within the 4TMH
class is the chloride channel 4TMH family. A jump of hydrophobicity is observed in
TMH2 (hydrophobicity = 1.05) to TMH3 (hydrophobicity = 1.50) (Welch’s t-test Pvalue = 5.34E-5, from 50 records) (Figure 4.10B).

Summary

Marginally hydrophobic TMHs are often essential physiological components for carrying out complex intra-membrane tasks beyond membrane anchorage, and widely
prevalent among TMPs [35]. However, this presents a significant biophysical and

this is a conserved issue. There is evidence to suggest that multipass TMH arrangements work cooperatively during translocation and insertion to achieve correct folding
of marginally hydrophobic TMHs [jemalm2012, 19, 291, 301–304, 320–324] (Figure

hydrophobic TMHs remain in association with the translocon machinery until the marginally hydrophobic TMH is released into the membrane. This was observed in an opsin protein [320]. B)
TMH-TMH interactions allow the marginally hydrophobic TMH to shield the polar residues. The
marginally hydrophobic TMH can associate with the typical hydrophobic TMH in the ribosomal exit
tunnel [291] or in the translocon tunnel [321]. This was observed in a potassium ion channel [19, 291,
321].

Here, we have shown that high discrepancy of TMSOC z-score (simple-complex
score) [23, 38], and several hydrophobicity scales [34, 84, 106, 111] can be used to
identify TMH groups that must work cooperatively to incorporate the marginally hydrophobic TMHs. Here we have shown that the hydrophobic relationships between
these cooperatively inserted TMHs are conserved throughout their larger families indicating that cooperative insertion may be a routine mechanism for the insertion of some
families of TMPs. So far, this method has shown that the TMH7 of GPCRs is a conserved marginally hydrophobic TMH with the typically hydrophobic TMH6 preceding
it. In opsins, TMH5-TMH7 are incorporated into the membrane together simultaneously by staying in association with the translocon until TMH7 emerges [320]. We
see this pattern across several GPCR sub-families and the GPCR family as a whole.

156

CHAPTER 4. COOPERATION BETWEEN TMHS...

Furthermore, we found that the charged TMH4 of 6TMH ion channels has a typically
hydrophobic TMH3 preceding it and a more hydrophobic TMH5 following it. Indeed
there is evidence that TMH3 and TMH4 cannot incorporate alone [323], that TMH3
and TMH4 can insert as a pair from the translocon simultaneously [19, 321].
With the emergence of advanced cross-linking experiments and APs that can probe
energetics and TMH-TMH interactions dynamically during ribosomal translation and
membrane insertion, we suggest that TMHs with highly contrasting hydrophobicity
and TMSOC z-score could yield interesting examples of cooperative insertion during
translocation. For example, here we find discrepencies in the TMH6 and TMH11 to
their adjacent TMHs of sugar transporters as well as TMH2 and TMH3 in ion channels,
specifically in chloride channels. Understanding the biogenesis of proteins is essential
to solving misfolding in disease phenotypes and for developing viable TMP chassis in
synthetic biology.

Outlook
The hydrophobicity–sequence complexity continuum

We hypothesise that the hydrophobicity–sequence complexity continuum contains nuanced codes for different functions and that such differentiation of sequence and structural properties will allow assignment to these varying functions. Additionally, we
suggest probing functional classification of yet uncharacterised membrane proteins by
similarities of combinations of complex TM sets to well studied membrane proteins and
finding those classes of TM proteins where this principle is most directly applicable.
