Investigating the Recognition and Interactions of Non-Polar α Helices in
Biology
June 3, 2018

Abstract
Non–polar helices figure prominently in structural biology, from the first protein structure (myoglobin) through trans-membrane segments, to current work on recognition
of protein trafficking and quality control. Trans-membrane α helix containing proteins make around a quarter of all proteins, as well as two-thirds of drug targets, and
contain some of the most critical proteins required for life as we know it. Yet they
are fundamentally difficult to study experimentally. This is in part due to the very
features that make them so biologically influential: their non–polar trans-membrane
helix regions. What is missing in the current literature is a nuanced understanding
of the complexities of the helix composition beyond a hydrophobic region of around
20 residues. Currently, it is known that the properties of trans-membrane protein α
helices underpin membrane protein insertion mechanisms.
By leveraging large data-sets of trans-membrane proteins, this thesis is focused on
characterising features of α helices en masse, particularly regarding their topology,
membrane–protein interactions, and intramembrane protein interactions.
In this thesis, I make the argument that there are different classifications of transmembrane α helices. These have markedly different evolutionary pressures, these
different classes interact differently with the membrane, and each class serve the protein
differently.

Lay Abstract
The survival of each of our cells relies on a a cellular barrier to separate themselves
from the surrounding environment. This cellular skin can be thought of as the bag that
contains all the important machinery required for normal cell function. The barrier
works by being chemically very different to both the outside environment, and to the
inside of the cell, which in both cases are mostly water. The membrane is fatty, and
because of that, the membrane repels water.
Proteins are the molecular machinery that form much of the cell structure and
shape as well as carrying out many of the cell’s routine tasks. Around a third of
our genome codes for proteins that are permanently embedded in the membrane, but
because these proteins are adapted for a life in the water repelling cell wall, they are
very hard to study in laboratories which often rely on methods that hold proteins in
water based solutions.
In this thesis, we focus particularly on the parts of the protein that are embedded
in the water repelling cellular skin. Traditionally, these regions are hard to study,
because we must first remove them from the cellular wall, which causes problems since
the embedded regions also repel water and this often causes them to stick to one
another, making them hard to work with in a laboratory setting.
We analyse thousands of proteins to further our understanding of electrical charges
in the embedded regions and find that negative charge on the outside of the cell has
been evolutionary selected across bacteria, animals, and plants. This is especially
true for regions that specifically anchor the protein into the cellular wall. Where the
embedded regions have additional function, for example ferrying something in or out
of the cell, the negative charge “bias” can no longer be seen.
This thesis demonstrates the radically different evolutionary story that transmembrane regions have compared to other proteins; the sacrifices they make for their stability in order to maintain their function, and their optimisation through evolutionary
timescales to become mould to the membrane as best they can.

Chapter 1
Introduction
Trans-membrane (TM) biology is a huge and varied field that is ultimately the study
of the interface between compartments of the cell; one of the fundamental pillars
of life as we know it [Ladokhin2015]. Trans-membrane Protein (TMP)s include
some of the most critical to life proteins as well as a large number of drug targets.
However, the experimental inaccessibility of the TMH has hampered the progress of
study compared to their globular structural analogues. Despite progress over the last
decade, the understanding of the relationship between the sequence and function of a
TMH is incomplete.
In this chapter we will place the TMH problem in context, then describe the important biological aspects of the TMH (the traversing Trans-membrane Segment (TMS)
as well as the membrane itself), and discuss tools and methods that allow us to analyse
and describe the nuanced differences between these TMH sequences.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

TMHs [Baeza-Delgado2013], and 28.6±1.6Å to 33.5 ±3.1Å from 191 proteins depending on membrane types [Pogozheva2013]. There are a couple of reasons for this
variation. Primarily is that the boundaries of TMHs are extremely hard to precisely
identify since it is unclear exactly how far the TMH rises into the water interface
region [VonHeijne2006]. Secondly is that it is emerging that different membranes
have different thicknesses [VanMeer2008], and that this is directly reflected in the
hydrophobic lengths of the TMH [Sharpe2010, Pogozheva2013].

TMH. The example used here for illustrative purposes is the trans-membrane region of therein (Protein Data Bank (PDB) 2LK9) [Skasko2012]. Dark grey areas denote the area of lipid head groups.
The residues found in these areas are often described as flanking regions and are often in contact with
the aqueous interface of the membrane. The helix core is mostly composed of hydrophobic residues.
Although the regions labelled here generally hold true in terms of the statistical distribution of polar, non-polar, and charged groups, it is by no means absolute laws and many proteins break these
“rules” [Sharpe2010, Baeza-Delgado2013, Pogozheva2013].

From left to right: a typical and traditional TMH, an exceptionally long TMH, a
TMH that lies flat in the interface region, a kinked helix that enters and exits the bilayer on the same leaflet, a TMH that is not long enough to span the entire membrane.
These exceptional formations present a challenge for topology predictions of the loop
regions.

1.1. α HELICES; STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

17

The language used to describe TMHs varies somewhat across the literature, primarily due to a changing understanding of TMH general structure and relevance to
function over the last 15 years or so. There is a general composition of a TMH despite
specific protein and membrane constraints [Sharpe2010].
A study by Baeza–Delgado et al. from 2013 [Baeza-Delgado2013] looked at
TMHs in 170 integral membrane proteins from a manually maintained database of experimentally confirmed TMPs; MPTopo [Jayasinghe2001]. The group examined the
distribution of residues along the TMHs. As expected, half of the natural amino acids
are equally distributed along transmembrane (TM) helices whereas aromatic, polar,
and charged amino acids along with proline are biasedly near the flanks of the TM helices [Baeza-Delgado2013]. It has been noted that transitions between the polar and
non-polar groups at the ends of the hydrophobic core occur in a more defined edge on
the cytoplasmic side than at the extracytoplasmic face when counting from the middle
of the helix outwards [Baeza-Delgado2013]. This is probably reflecting the different
lipid composition of both leaflets of biological membranes [Baeza-Delgado2013].
A previous study by Sharpe et al. from 2010 used 1192 human and 1119 yeast
predicted TMHs that were not structurally validated to further explore the difference
in TMH and leaflet structure by exploiting the evolutionary conserved sequence differences between the TMH in the inner and outer leaflets [Sharpe2010]. TMHs from
vertebrates and invertebrates were found to be reasonably similar compositionally. The
differences in consensus TMH structure implies that there are general differences between the membranes of the Golgi and Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). The abundance
of serines in the region following the lumenal end of Golgi TMSs probably reflects
the fact that this part of many Golgi enzymes forms a flexible linker that tethers the
catalytic domain to the membrane [Sharpe2010].

The “Positive-Inside” Rule
Two publications by von Heijne coined the “Positive-Inside” rule demonstrated the
practical value of positively charged residue sequence clustering in topology prediction
of TMHs in bacteria [VonHeijne1989, Andersson1992]. It was clearly defined and
shown that positively charged residues more commonly were found on the “inside” of
the cytoplasm rather than the periplasm of E. coli. More recently still large-scale

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

sequence analysis of TMHs from different organelle membrane surfaces in eukaryotic proteomes, show the clustering of positive charge being cytosolic [Sharpe2010,
Baeza-Delgado2013, Pogozheva2013].
The Aromatic Belt
Tyrosine and tryptophan residues commonly are found at the interface boundaries of
the TMH and this feature is called the “aromatic belt” [Hessa2005, Granseth2005,
Sharpe2010, Baeza-Delgado2013, Nilsson2005a]. Not all aromatic residues are
not found in the aromatic belt; phenylalanine has no particular preference for this
region [Granseth2005, Braun1999]. However, it still remains unclear if this is to
do with anchorage or translocon recognition [Baeza-Delgado2013].
A study of conserved tryptophan residues during folding of integrin αIIβ3 TM
complex demonstrated the anchoring effects of tryptophan (0.4 kcal/mol contribution
to membrane stability) in TMHs is greater than the other residues [Situ2018]. It was
suggested that it’s wide amphiphilic range (it’s stabilising energetic contribution in
either hydrophobic or polar sites) complements the heterogeneity and asymmetry of
mammalian membrane lipids in particular.
The Tyrosine side chain is a six-membered aromatic ring with an OH group attached. Tryptophan has two aromatic rings that are fused into one large hydrophobic
ring-structure. Phenylalanine, although aromatic, is completely hydrophobic, and
is found in the trans-membrane part rather than the interfacial parts of MPs. The
classical explanation for the preference of Tyrosine and Tryptophan to reside in the interfacial regions is their dipolar character. The side chain must simply seekmpromise.
This can be achieved by burying the aromatic ring close to, or within, the hydrophobic
core, while the hydrophilic part can interact with the polar lipid head-groups at the interface. Other factors such as the aromaticity, size, rigidity and shape of Tryptophan,
rather than its dipolar character, has also been suggested as the primary reasons for
its interfacial preference.
Snorkelling
Broadly speaking, TMHs are non-polar. However, some contain polar and charged
residues in the helix itself. Whilst this might seem thermodynamically unstable at first

1.1. α HELICES; STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

19

glance, a molecular dynamic feature called the “snorkel” effect explains in part how
this is possible [Chamberlain2004, Strandberg2003]. Simply put, the snorkelling
effect involves the long flexible side chain of leucine reaching the water interface region
to interact with the polar head-groups of the bilayer even when the α helix backbone is
pulled into the hydrophobic layer [Krishnakumar2007]. This has also been suggested
to allow helices to adapt to varying thicknesses of the membrane [Kandasamy2006].
More recently it was found that although in simulations the energetic cost of arginine
at the centre of the TMH is large, in vivo experimentation with the Sec61 translocon
reveals a much smaller penalty [Ulmschneider2017]. That same study also found
that in simulations, snorkelling, bilayer deformation, and peptide tilting combined to
to be sufficient to lower the thermodynamic stability penalty of arginine insertion so
that hydrophobic TMHs with a central arginine residue will readily insert into the
membrane.

1.1.2

Hydrophobicity of Trans-membrane Segments

Perhaps the most prevalent and important feature of the trans-membrane regions is
the membrane spanning region which is composed mostly of non-polar residues. More
recently the hydrophobic group region has been associated with cell localisation and
a broad range of biochemical functions [Junne2010, Wong2012].
Over the last 50 years or so, there have been many attempts to use hydrophobicity scales of residues to predict structural classifications of proteins. Due to the
vast amounts of scales, major efforts have been made to compare them to identify
which ones are better for which tasks of identifying structural elements [Simm2016,
Peters2014]. Simm et al. 2016 [Simm2016] compared 98 scales and found that the
accuracy of a scale for secondary structure prediction depends on the spacing of the
hydrophobicity values of certain amino acids but generally that the methods behind
the scales don’t affect the separation capacity between β sheets or α helices.
Throughout this thesis, several scales are used to evaluate and estimate hydrophobic values of peptide chains. All the scales aim for quantifying the hydrophobic values
of each residue. There are several key differences in their methodology, assumptions,
and aims. Ultimately, all the scales are attempting to allow estimation of ∆Gwhf ;
the free energy of a folded helix (f ) from the water (w) into the membrane core (h).

20

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

This free energy measurement is regarded as being currently experimentally inaccessible [Cymer2015].
Although as a trend most of the scales agree, because of the methodological differences, there are indeed variations of values even after normalisation. Due to these
discrepancies, it is preferable and typical amongst the literature to use several scales
to verify the observable trends resulting from interpretation from an individual scale.
Notably, one of the classic scales, Kyte & Doolittle Hydropathy Scale shows a striking
similarity to the modern Hessa’s ∆Gaa
app scale, and that generally the “better” scales
count proline as hydrophilic, and focus on helix recognition rather than amino acid
analogues [Peters2014]. In α helices from soluble proteins, proline is almost always
a helix breaker, and α helix prediction scales don’t even attempt to quantify a proline
scoring penalty. Several of the scales used throughout this thesis are outlined below.
Kyte & Doolittle Hydropathy Scale
A scale based on the water–vapour transfer free energy and the interior-exterior distribution of individual amino acids [Kyte1982].
Hessa’s Biological Hydrophobicity Scale
This is arguably the most biologically relevant scale [Peters2014], and is often called
the ∆Gaa
app scale. The scale is based on an experimental method where the free energy
exchange during recognition of designed poly-peptide TMH by the ER Sec61 translocon
occurred [Hessa2005]. These measurements were then used to calculate a biological
hydrophobicity scale. The original study reported positional variance in some residues
and is strictly valid only for residues in the core of the TMH. A more refined study
quantified the positional dependencies of each amino acid type [Hessa2007].
White and Wimley Octanol – Interface Whole Residue Scale
This scale is calculated from two other scales; the octanol scale, and the interface
scale [White1999]. This scale is fundamentally based on the partitioning of hostguest pentapeptides (acetyl-WL-X-LL-OH) and another set of peptides (AcWLm)
between water and octanol, as well as water to Palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine
(POPC).

1.1.3

Sequence Complexity

Sequence properties that can be analysed by bioinformatics, the sequence complexity
and hydrophobicity, of the TMH have been used to predict the role of the TMH as
either functional or structural, and as a discrete cluster from other SCOP annotated
helices [Wong2012]. Those findings demonstrated that the sequence of the TMH
holds valuable information regarding biological roles, and forms the basis of our interest
in the link between the polarity of a helix and functional activity beyond structural
anchorage.
TMSOC’s z-score is able to distinguish between functionally active TMHs and those
only associated with anchorage [Wong2012]. The z-score is a product of both hydrophobicity and a Shannon like sequence entropy of the character string in the TMH.
This term is described below in equation 1.1.

Where xc and xΦ are moving window averages of c, the sequence entropy [Wootton1996]. Φ is the White and Wimley hydrophobicity [White1999]
for a given segment and µ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the sequence
entropy and hydrophobicity of the functional TMH set, that is those TMHs containing
active residues.
Sequence entropy, is essentially an estimate of the linguistic entropy of a string. In
the context of biology can be thought of as an estimation of the non-randomness of a

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

sequence. Sequence complexity can be used to analyse DNA sequences [Pinho2013,
Oliver1993, Troyanskaya2002], however here we will focus on the analysis of the
complexity of a sequence in protein sequences.
Broadly speaking, the information theory entropy of a linguistic string can be
defined as in equation 1.2.

H(S) = −

n
X

pi logs (pi )

(1.2)

i=1

Where H is the entropy of a sequence (S), and pi is the probability of a character i through each position (n) in S. This allows us to quantify the average relative
information density held within a string of information [Shannon1948].
The compositional complexity is measured over sequence windows. If we have an
amino acid composition {ni }i = min i, . . . , max i with a window length of L = Σni ,
the total number of sequences can be calculated by dividing a factorial of the length
by the product of the compositions, i.e N = L!/Πni possible sequences. The SEG
algorithm [WOOTTON1994269, Wootton1996] identifies sub-segments of the raw
region which have the lowest probability. The algorithm searches for and concatenates
sub-threshold segments for the Shannon entropy-like term in equation 1.3

The lowest probability sub-segment can be defined as K1 = log N/L. By altering
the window lengths, and the thresholds SEG can be optimised to search for subtle
compositional deviations, such as coil-coiled regions.

α Helices In Membranes
The Transmembrane Protein Problem

Because of the experimental hindrance, TMP biology has been relatively slow to
emerge. Throughout the 1990s the concept of a TMH was simple and fairly assured:
they were greasy peptides of around 30Å in length, often bundled together and oriented perpendicularly to the membrane. By 2006, crystallography had elucidated more
than 60 high-resolution structures. Although the classic TMH structures were broadly

1.2. α HELICES IN MEMBRANES

23

prevalent, these structures contained a plethora of unusual TMHs. TMSs are capable
of partial spanning of the membrane, spanning using oblique angles, and even lying flat
on the membrane surface [VonHeijne2006, Elofsson2007]; the classical model was
incomplete. Even recently, there is a contingency in the membrane biology field that
despite progress over the last decade there is still a lack of information regarding the
relationship between TMH sequences and function, TMH structure, intra-membrane
TMP assembly, and the behaviour of TMHs in the lipid bilayer; the native biological
environment of TMHs [Ladokhin2015].
Furthermore, the insertion and formation of the unusually orientated TMHs and
of the more traditional TMHs have been shown to be underpinned by complex
thermodynamic equilibrium and electrostatic interactions [Cymer2015, Elisa2012,
Ismail2015]. As well as being a biophysically convoluted system, TMHs are biologically functional beyond anchorage in many cases. TMSs have been identified as regulators of protein quality control and trafficking mechanisms, shifting the idea away
from TMHs broadly exclusively functioning as anchors [Hessa2011], and crucially
this function beyond anchorage can be revealed by sensitive, careful analysis of the
sequence information alone [Wong2012].
When predicting the function of any protein, one follows the dicta that function
is facilitated by form, and form is determined by the sequence; the more similar the
sequences, the more likely that the function is similar. For globular soluble proteins having the same folds induces strict biochemical restrictions on the packing of
a hydrophobic protein core which requires similarity of non-polar residue patterns.
Sequence analysis of non-globular TMPs has not been studied to nearly the same extent yet homology paradigms are silently extended and applied to them. In the case
of Signal Peptide (SP)s or TMSs the physical constraints are similar for all TMPs,
and so matching is indeed merely a reflection of the physical environment of the bilayer, not the common ancestry. Worryingly, because of this oversight, it appears
that between 2.1% and 13.6% of Pfam hits for SPs or TMSs are indeed false positive
results [Wong2010].
Over the last decade, Nanodiscs have been routinely used to much more easily
obtain crystal structures. Nanodiscs overcome some of the major challenges caused by
the hydrophobic helices and a more faithful representation of the biological membranes

24

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

than alternative model membranes like liposomes [Borch2009].
However, critical questions remain: How is the TMH oriented in the membrane,
how is the TMH interacting with the membrane, how is the TMH interacting with
another TMH in the membrane, does the TMH have functions beyond anchorage and
if so what are they?

1.2.2

The Importance Of Transmembrane Proteins

Membrane-bound proteins underpin almost every biological process directly, or indirectly, from photosynthesis to respiration. Integral TMP are encoded by between a
third to a half of the genes in the human genome which reflects their biological importance [Hopkins2002, Almen2009, Wang2013]. These proteins allow biochemical
pathways that traverse the various biological membranes used in life.
The relationship between the membrane and TMPs is underpinned by complex
thermodynamic and electrostatic equilibrium. Once inserted the protein doesn’t leave
the membrane as a result of the TMH being very hydrophobic. This hydrophobicity
and the hydrophobicity of the lipid tails means that they self-associate and this association is entropically driven by water. Another way of describing it is that they
fiercely dissociate from the water. The overall ∆G for a TMH in the membrane is
-12kcalmol−1 [Cymer2015]; the association of the helix in the membrane is typically
spontaneous.

1.3

Biological Membrane Composition

”before we discuss the membrane proteins, one must consider the biological reason
as for why they exist.” The outline that MPs are vital for relaying information and
chemistry across the membrane.

1.3.1

Lipids of the Membrane

The compartmentalisation of cellular biochemistry is arguably one of the most significant events to have occurred in evolution and is certainly one of the fundamental
prerequisites for life [Koshland2002]. The proteins that allow life to use this biochemical barrier are perhaps equally important. Together, the lipid bilayer and proteins

1.3. BIOLOGICAL MEMBRANE COMPOSITION

25

therein allow complex biochemical systems that facilitate life as we know it.
It is critical to understand that the lipid bilayer and the trans-membrane α helices are inextricably linked, and often what we observe from the α helices reflect
the properties of the much harder to study membranes. The lipid membranes influence the local structure, dynamics, and activity of proteins in the membrane in nontrivial ways [Bondar2010, Bondar2009, Jardon-Valadez2010, Kalvodova2005,
Urban2005, White2001a, Jensen2004, Henin2014], as well as protein folding [Kauko2010].
There is a rich variety of lipid molecules that make up the biological membranes.
The majority of lipids in higher organism membranes are phospholipids, sphingolipids,
and sterols. These are composed of a glycerol molecule. Bonded to the glycerol
molecule are two hydrophobic fatty acid tail groups and a negatively-charged polar
phosphate group. The polar phosphate group is modified with an alcohol group. Water
entropically drives the self-association of the lipid molecules. In other words, the
bilayer forms from these phospholipid molecules due to the fierce dissociation between
the polar water and the hydrophobic tails. Furthermore, the bilayer maximises van der
Waals interactions between the closely-packed hydrocarbon chains, which contributes
to the stability of the bilayer. This can be seen even in relatively early Molecular
Dynamics (MD) simulations [Goetz1998].

Differences in Membrane Compositions
It has been known for some time that the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria are asymmetric in terms of lipid composition. The outer membranes contain
lipopolysaccharide, whilst the inner is a mixture of approximately 25 phospholipid
types. Adding to the membrane asymmetry composition story, a thorough analysis of
residue composition in yeast and human TMH regions revealed intra-membrane leaflet
composition asymmetry in the ER, but not the Golgi [Sharpe2010]. Furthermore,
proteinlipid interactions have been shown to be determinants of membrane curvature [Jensen2004], and undertake complex orientations and conformations to allow
for hydrophobic mismatch [Planque2003]. It may need changing with every bib.tex
update unless the permanent record is changed.

26

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

1.3.2

Membrane Potential

Simply put, membrane potential is the voltage across a membrane. If the membrane
is permeable to a certain type of ion, then the ion will experience an electrical pulling
force during the diffusion process that pulls toward the “preferred” biological location.
This clearly depends on a chemical component involving both the charge and ion
concentration gradient.There are various ways of estimating the membrane potential
ab initio.
The Nernst equation can be derived directly from the simplified thermodynamic
principles (i) the Boltzmann distribution, and (ii) a field charge interaction energy [Feiner1994]. It is defined as:

Em =

RT
cout
× ln
F
cin

(1.4)

Where charge Em is the membrane potential, z is the ion charge, c is the concentration of an ion in that cell environment.
One problem in a biological membranes is that the compartments always involve
multiple ion channels. The Goldman equation aims to solve this problem by accounting for several ions that contribute to cout and cin (such as K + , N a+ , and Cl− )
simultaneously:
RT
Em =
× ln
F



pK + · [K + ]out + pN a+ · [N a+ ]out + pCl− · [Cl− ]in
pK + · [K + ]in + pN a+ · [N a+ ]in + pCl− · [Cl− ]out


(1.5)

Where charge Em is the membrane potential, z is the ion charge, [i] is the ion
concentration and pi is the relative membrane permeability for the actual ion.
However, it is rife with caveats caused by the assumptions of the simplified model.
Such assumptions include ions having point charge, that the potential is constant
throughout the solution. This is compounded because it assumes the constant potential is the same as the point of measurement which can be heavily influenced by,
for example, a specific adsorption of either part of the redox pair or the competitive
adsorption of a supporting ion in solution [Feiner1994]. Therefore one should be
cautious to understand the limitations and variability when extrapolating experimentally determined E0 , particularly when using such an idealised model in a biological
context.

1.4. BIOGENESIS OF TRANS-MEMBRANE PROTEINS

Organelle Membrane Potentials
Several studies have attempted to quantify the various voltages across the intracellular membranes. Negativity was found in the ER, with a voltage between between
75mV to 95mV in the ER membrane [Qin2011, Worley1994]. Negativity was found
in the mitochondrial matrix with a voltage across the mitochondrial membrane at
150mV [Perry2011]. No notable membrane potential has been identified in the
Golgi [Schapiro2000, Llopis1998].

Biogenesis of Trans-membrane Proteins
Translocation Overview

There are, broadly speaking, 3 types of translocation; BiP-mediated eukaryotic posttranslational translocation, bacterial post-translational insertion using the Tat system
for folded proteins and the Sec system for unfolded proteins, and co-translational insertion in bacteria through the Holotranslocon (HTL) protein complex or its individual
components.
Translocation is when a ribosome translates the Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) to a
nascent peptide chain which is handed directly or indirectly to insertion machinery
which threads the chain through and, in the case of TMHs, releases the TMH into the
membrane environment.

1.4.2

Co-Translational Translocation

The overwhelming majority of TMPs use the co-translational method of translocation.
It has long been understood that this method is essentially the Signal Recognition
Particle (SRP) recognising and attaching to the nascent peptide chain whilst it is still
associated with the ribosome, and the SRP then targets the peptide and ribosome
to a Signal Recognition Particle Receptor (SR) in association with some membrane
insertion machinery on the ER [Pool2005, Hessa2005].
Crystal structures showed the SRP targets the nascent peptide chain for membrane insertion via a GTPase in both the SRP and SR, that is initially associated
with the translocon machinery, coming together to form a complex thus bringing the

28

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

nascent peptide chain in proximity to the translocon [Shan2005]. Mutant studies
ofSRP [Shan2005] revealed key discrete conformational stages. These are the specific recognition of signal sequences on cargo proteins, the targeting of the package
to the membrane, the handing over of the cargo to the translocation machinery all
the while maintaining precise spatial and temporal coordination of each molecular
event [Saraogi2011].

The “Negative-Outside” Rule
The description of a TMH remains incomplete. The understanding of TMP topology is erroneous, and despite a wealth of structures, the general model of helix-helix
and helix-lipid interactions remains speculative and requires a great deal of intensive
analysis to generate a working model of a particular TMP.
The work presented in this chapter is an expanded version of published
work [Baker2017]. We use advanced statistical analysis to analyse large sequence
datasets that have rich topological annotation. By analysing these sequences in the
context of anchorage, we find that some TMHs are confined to biological constraints of
the membrane, whereas others that likely contain function beyond anchorage, are less
conforming to the membrane. Specifically, there is further elaboration of statistical
definitions in the methods than in the published paper.

Abstract

Summary

As the idea of positive residues inside the cytoplasm emerged during the late 1980s,
so did the idea of negative residues working in concert with TMH orientation. It
was shown that removing a single lysine residue reversed the topology of a model
erichia coli protein, whereas much higher numbers of negatively charged residues are
needed to reverse topology [Nilsson1990]. One would also expect to see a skew in
negatively charged distribution if a cooperation between oppositely charged residues

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

orientated a TMH, however there is no conclusive evidence in the literature for an
opposing negatively charged skew [Granseth2005, Nilsson2005a, Sharpe2010,
Baeza-Delgado2013, Pogozheva2013]. However, in E. coli negative residues do
experience electrical pulling forces when travelling through the SecYEG translocon indicating that negative charges are biologically relevant [Ismail2015]. In this chapter,
we explore the literature surrounding charged residue distribution in the TMH, and
demonstrate that the “negative-outside” skew exists in anchoring TMHs

2.3

Introduction

Two decades ago, the classic concept of a TMH was a rather simple story: Typical TMPs were thought to be anchored in the membrane by membrane-spanning bundles of non-polar α–helices of roughly 20 residues length, with a consistent orientation
of being perpendicular to the membrane surface. Although this is broadly true, hundreds of high quality membrane structures have elucidated that membrane-embedded
helices can adopt a plethora of lengths and orientations within the membrane. They
are capable of just partial spanning of the membrane, spanning using oblique angles, and even lying flat on the membrane surface [Elofsson2007, VonHeijne2006].
The insertion and formation of the TMHs follow a complex thermodynamic equilibrium [Moon2013, MacCallum2011, Cymer2015]. From the biological function
point of view, many TMHs have multiple roles besides being just hydrophobic anchors; for example, certain TMHs have been identified as regulators of protein quality
control and trafficking mechanisms [Hessa2011]. As these additional biological functions are mirrored in the TMHs sequence patterns, TMHs can be classified as simple
(just hydrophobic anchors) and complex sequence segments [Wong2010, Wong2011,
Wong2012].
The relationship between sequence patterns in and in the vicinity of TMHs
and their structural and functional properties, as well as their interaction with the
lipid bilayer membrane, has been a field of intensive research in the last three
decades [Ladokhin2015]. Besides the span of generally hydrophobic residues in

2.3. INTRODUCTION

31

the TMH, there are other trends in the sequence such as with a saddle-like distribution of polar residues (depressed incidence of charged residues in the TMH itself), an enriched occurrence of positively charged residues in the cytosolic flanking regions as well as an increased likelihood of tryptophan and Tyrosine at either flank edge [Sharpe2010, VonHeijne1986, VonHeijne1988, VonHeijne1989,
Baeza-Delgado2013, Granseth2005]. Such properties vary somewhat in length
and intensity between various biological organelle membranes, between prokaryotes
and eukaryotes [Ojemalm2013] and even among eukaryotic species studied due to
slightly different membrane constraints [Sharpe2010, Pogozheva2013]. These biological dispositions are exploitable in terms of TM region prediction in query protein sequences [Beuming2004, Zhao2006] and tools such as the quite reliable
TMHMM [Krogh2001, Sonnhammer1998], Phobius [Kall2004, Kall2007] or
DAS-TMfilter represent todays prediction limit of TMHs hydrophobic cores within
the protein sequence [Cserzo2002, Cserzo2004, Kall2002]. The prediction accuracy for true positives and negatives is reported to be close to 100% and the remaining
main cause of false positive prediction are hydrophobic α–helices completely buried in
the hydrophobic core of proteins. To note, reliable prediction of TMHs and protein
topology is a strong restriction for protein function of even otherwise noncharacterised
proteins [Eisenhaber2016, Eisenhaber2012, Sherman2015] and thus, very valuable information.

The

“positiveinside

rule”

reported

by

von

Heijne

[VonHeijne2006,

VonHeijne1989] postulates the preferential occurrence of positively charged
residues (lysine and arginine) at the cytoplasmic edge of TMHs. The practical value
of positively charged residue sequence clustering in topology prediction of TMH was
first shown for the plasmalemma in bacteria [VonHeijne1989, Sipos1993]. As a
trend, the “positive-inside rule” has since been confirmed with statistical observations
for most membrane proteins and biological membrane types [Baeza-Delgado2013,
Gavel1991, Nilsson2005a, Wallin1998]. However, more recent evidence suggests
that, in thylakoid membranes, the “positive-inside rule” is less applicable due to the
co-occurrence of aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues together with positively
charged residues [Pogozheva2013].

32

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE
The positive-inside rule also received support from protein engineering experi-

ments that revealed conclusive evidence for positive charges as a topological determinant [VonHeijne1989, Beltzer1991, Kida2006, Nilsson1990]. Mutational experiments demonstrated that charged residues, when inserted into the centre of the
helix, had a large effect on insertion capabilities of the TMH via the translocon. Insertion becomes more unfavourable when the charge was placed closer to the TMH
core [Hessa2005].
It remains unclear exactly why and how exactly the positive charge determines
topology from a biophysical perspective. Positively charged residues are suggested to
be stronger determinants of topology than negatively charged residues due to a dampening of the translocation potential of negatively charged residues. This dampening
factor is the result of protein-lipid interactions with net zero charged phospholipid,
phosphatidylethanolamine and other neutral lipids. This effect favours cytoplasmic
retention of positively charged residues [Bogdanov2014].
The recent accumulation of TMP sequences and structures allowed revisiting the
problem of charged residue distribution in TMHs (see also http://blanco.biomol.
uci.edu/mpstruc/). For example, whilst β–sheets contain charged residues in the TM
region, -helices generally do not (38). Large-scale sequence analysis of TMH from
various organelle membrane surfaces in eukaryotic proteomes confirm the clustering
of positive charge having a statistical bias for the cytosolic side of the membrane. At
the same time, there are many TMH exception examples to the positive-inside rule;
however as a trend, topology can be determined by simply looking for the most positive
loop region between helices [Sharpe2010, Baeza-Delgado2013].
When the observation of positively charged residues preferentially localised at the
cytoplasmic edge of TMHs emerged, it was also asked whether negatively charged
residues work in concert with TMH orientation. It was shown that a single additional lysine residue can reverse the topology of a model Escherichia coli protein,
whereas a much higher number of negatively charged residues is needed to achieve
the same [Nilsson1990]; nevertheless, a sufficiently large negative charge can overturn the positive-inside rule [Andersson1993, Kim1994] and, thus indeed, negative
residues are topologically active to a point. Negatively charged residues were observed

2.3. INTRODUCTION

33

in the flanks of TMHs [Baeza-Delgado2013], especially of marginally hydrophobic TM regions [Delgado-Partin1998]. It is known that the negatively charged
acidic residues in TM regions have a non-trivial role in the biological context. In E.
coli, negative residues experience electrical pulling forces when travelling through the
SecYEG translocon indicating that negative charges are biologically relevant during
the electrostatic interactions of insertion [Ismail2012, Ismail2015].
Unfortunately, there is a problem with statistical evidence for preferential negative charge occurrence next to TMH regions. Early investigations indicated overall both positive and negative charge were influential topology factors, dubbed the
charge balance rule. If true, one would also expect to see a skew in the negative
charge distribution if a cooperation between oppositely charged residues orientated
a TMH [Sipos1993, Hartmann1989]. It might be expected that, if positive residues
force the loop or tail to stay inside, negative residues would be drawn outside and
topology would be determined not unlike electrophoresis. Yet, there is plenty of individual protein examples but no conclusive statistical evidence in the current literature
for a negatively charged skew [Sharpe2010, Baeza-Delgado2013, Granseth2005,
Pogozheva2013, Nilsson2005a, Andersson1992].
There are many observations described in the literature that charged residues
determine topology more predictably in single-pass proteins than in multipass TMH [Kim1994, Harley1998]. It is thought that the charges only determine
the initial orientation of the TMH in the biological membrane; yet, the ultimate orientation must be determined together with the totality of subsequent downstream
regions [Sato1998].
With sequence-based hydrophobicity and volume analysis and consensus sequence
studies, Sharpe et al. [Sharpe2010] demonstrated that there is asymmetry in the
intramembranous space of some membranes. Crucially, this asymmetry differs among
the membrane of various organelles. They conclude that there are general differences
between the lipid composition and organisation in membranes of the Golgi and ER.
Functional aspects are also important. For example, the abundance of serines in the
region following the lumenal end of Golgi TMHs appears to reflect the fact that this
part of many Golgi enzymes forms a flexible linker that tethers the catalytic domain
to the membrane [Sharpe2010].

34

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE
A study by Baeza-Delgado et al. [Baeza-Delgado2013] analysed the distri-

bution of amino acid residue types in TMHs in 170 integral membrane proteins
from a manually maintained database of experimentally confirmed TMPs (MPTopo [Jayasinghe2001]) as well as in 930 structures from the PDB. As expected,
half of the natural amino acids are equally distributed along TMH whereas aromatic,
polar and charged amino acids along with proline are biased near the flanks of the TM
helices. Unsurprisingly, leucine and other non-polar residues are far more abundant
than the charged residues in the TM region [Sharpe2010].
In this work, we revisit the issue of statistical evidence for the preferential distribution of negatively charged (and a few other) residues within and nearby TMHs. We
rely on the improved availability of comprehensive and large sequence and structure
datasets for TM proteins. We also show that several methodical aspects have hindered
previous studies [Sharpe2010, Baeza-Delgado2013, Pogozheva2013] to see the
consistent non-trivial skew for negatively charged residues disfavouring the cytosolic interfacial region and/or preferring the outside flank. First, we show that acidic residues
are especially rare within and in the close sequence environment of TMHs, even when
compared to positively charged lysine and arginine. Second, therefore, the manner of
normalisation is critical: Taken together with the difficulty to properly align TMHs
relative to their boundaries, column-wise frequency calculations relative to all amino
acid types as in previous studies will blur possible preferential localisations of negative
charges in the sequence. However, the outcome changes when we ask where a negative
charge occurs in the sequence relative to the total amount of negative charges in the
respective sequence region. Thus, by accounting for the rarity of acidic residues with
sensitive normalisation, the “non-negative inside rule/negative-outside rule” is clearly
supported by the statistical data. We find that minor changes in the flank definitions
such as taking the TMH boundaries from the database or by generating flanks by
centrally aligning TMHs and applying some standardised TMH length does not have
a noticeable influence on the charge bias detected.
Third, there are significant differences in the distribution of amino acid residues
between single-pass and multi-pass TM regions in both the intra-membrane helix and
the flanking regions with further variations introduced by taxa and by the organelles
along the secretory pathway. Importantly, we find that it is critical to weigh down the

2.4. RESULTS

35

effect of TMHs in multi-pass TMPs with no or super-short flanks to observe statistical
significance for the charge bias. To say it bluntly, if there are no flanks of sufficient
length, there is also no negative charge bias to be observed.
The charge bias effect is even clearer when a classification of TMHs into so-called
simple (which, as a trend, are mostly single-pass and mere anchors) and so-called
complex (which typically have functions beyond anchorage) is considered [Wong2010,
Wong2011, Wong2012]. We also observe parallel skews with regard to leucine,
tyrosine, tryptophan and cysteine distributions. With these large-scale datasets and
a sensitive normalisation approach, new sequence features are revealed that provide
spatial insight into TMH membrane anchoring, recognition, helix-lipid, and helix-helix
interactions.

Acidic residues within and nearby TMH segments are
rare

In order to reliably compare the amino acid sequence properties of TMHs, we assembled datasets of TMH proteins from what are likely to be the best in terms of
quality and comprehensiveness of annotation in eukaryotic and prokaryotic representative genomes, as well as composite datasets to represent larger taxonomic groups
and with regard to sub-cellular locations (see Table 2.1).

In total, 3292 single-

pass TMH segments and 29898 multi-pass TMH segments were extracted from various UniProt [TheUniProtConsortium2014] text files according to TRANSMEM
annotation (download dated 20–03–2016). The UniProt datasets used only included
manually curated records; however, it is still necessary to check for systematic bias
due to the prediction methods used by UniProt for TMH annotation in the majority of cases without direct experimental evidence. Therefore, a fully experimentally
verified dataset was also generated for comparison. The representative 1544 singlepass and 15563 TMHs were extracted from the manually curated experimentally verified TOPDB [Dobson2015] database (download dated 21–03–2016) referred to as

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

ExpAll here (Table1). TMH organelle residency is defined according to UniProt annotation. To ensure reliability, organelles were only analysed from a representative
redundancy-reduced protein dataset of the most well-studied genome: Homo sapiens
(referred to as UniHuman herein). The several datasets from UniProt are subdivided
into different human organelles (UniPM, UniER, UniGolgi) and taxonomical groups
(UniHuman, UniCress, UniBacilli, UniEcoli, UniArch, UniFungi) as described in Table 2.1 (see also Methods section). As will be shown below, these various datasets
allow us to validate our findings for a variety of conditions, namely with regard (i) to
experimental verification of TMHs, (ii) to origin from various species and taxonomic
groups, (iii) to the number of TMHs in the same protein as well as (iv) to subcellular localisation. Data-sets and programs used in this work can be downloaded
from http://mendel.bii.a-star.edu.sg/SEQUENCES/NNI/.

The hydrophobic nature of the lipid bilayer membrane implies that, generally,
charged residues should be rare within TMHs. For acidic residues, even the location

2.4. RESULTS

37

in the sequence vicinity of TMHs should be disfavoured because of the negatively
charged head groups of lipids directed towards the aqueous extracellular side or the
cytoplasm. In agreement with the biophysically justified expectations, the statistical
data confirms that acidic residues are especially rare in TMHs and their flanking
regions. In Figure 1 where we plot the total abundance of all amino acid types in
single-pass TMHs and multi-pass TMHs (including their ±5 flanking residues), acidic
residues were found to be amongst the rarest amino acids both in UniHuman and
ExpAll.

Amino acid types on the horizontal axis are listed in descending count. The bars were coloured
according to categorisations of hydrophobic, neutral and hydrophilic types according to the free
energy of insertion biological scale [Hessa2005]. Grey represents hydrophilic amino acids that were
found to have a positive ∆G app, and blue represents hydrophobic residues with a negative ∆G app,
purple denotes negative residues and positive residues are coloured in orange. The abundances of key
residues are labelled.

The effect is most pronounced in single-pass TMPs (Figure 2.1). There are only
666 glutamates (just 1.24% of all residues) and 560 aspartates (1.05% respectively)
among the total set of 53238 residues comprised in 1705 TMHs and their flanks.
Within just the TMH regions, there are 71 glutamates (0.20% of all residues in TMHs
and flanks) and 58 aspartates (0.16% respectively). This cannot be an artefact of

38

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

UniProt TMH assignments since this feature is repeated in ExpAll. There are only
582 glutamates (1.22%) and 520 aspartates (1.09%) among the 47568 residues involved. Within the TMH itself, there are 64 glutamates (0.19%) and 69 aspartates
(0.21%). In both cases, the negatively charged residues represent the ultimate end of
the distribution. To note, acidic residues are rare even compared to positively charged
residues which are about 3–4 times more frequent. On a much smaller dataset of
single-spanning TMP, Nakashima et al.

[Nakashima1992] made similar composi-

tional studies. To compare, they found 0.94% glutamate and 0.94% aspartate within
just the TMH region (values very similar to ours from TMHs with small flanks; apparently, they used more outwardly defined TMH boundaries) but the content of each
glutamate and aspartate within the extracellular or cytoplasmic domains is larger by
an order of magnitude, between 5.26% and 9.34%. These latter values tend to be even
higher than the average glutamate and aspartate composition throughout the protein
database (5–6% [Nakashima1992]).
In the case of multi-pass TMPs (Figure 2.1), glutamates and aspartates are still
very rare in TMHs and their ±5 residue flanks (1.94% and 1.92% from the total of
377207 in the case of UniHuman respectively, 1.79% and 1.70% from the total of
454700 in the case of ExpAll). Yet, their occurrence is similar to those of histidine and
tryptophan and, notably, acidic residues are only about ∼1.5 times less frequent than
positively charged residues. The observation that acidic residues are more suppressed
in single-pass TMHs compared with the case of multi-pass TMHs is statistically significant. In Table 2.1, the acidic residues are counted in the helices (excluding flanking
regions) belonging to either multi-pass or single-pass helices. Indeed, single-pass helices appear to tolerate negative charge to a far lesser extent than multi-pass helices
as the data in the top two rows of Table 2.1 indicates (for datasets UniHuman and
ExpAll). The trend is strictly observed throughout sub-cellular localisations (rows 3–5
in Table 2.1) and taxa (rows 6–10). Statistical significance (P0.001) is found in all but
six cases. These are UniEcoli (D+E, D, E), UniArch (D+E, E) and UniFungi (E).
The problem is, most likely, that the respective datasets are quite small. Notably, the
difference between single- and multi-pass TMHs is greatest in UniPM; here, TMHs
from multi-pass proteins have on average 0.400 negative residues per helix, whereas
single-pass TMHs contained just 0.039 (P=3.86e-28).

Amino acid residue distribution analysis reveals a
“negative-not-inside/negative-outside” signal in singlepass TMH segments

The rarity of negatively charged residues is a complicating issue when studying their
distribution along the sequence positions of TMHs and their flanks. For UniHuman
and ExpAll , we plotted absolute abundance of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, lysine,
arginine, and leucine at each position (i.e., it scales as the equivalent fraction in the total composition of the alignment column) (Figure 2.2). To note, the known preference
of positively charged residues towards the cytoplasmic side is nevertheless evident. Yet,
it becomes apparent that any bias in the occurrence of the much rarer acidic residues
is overshadowed by fluctuations in the highly abundant residues such as leucine.
The trends become clearer if the occurrence of specific residues is normalised with
the total number of residues of the given amino acid type in the dataset observed in
the sequence region studied as shown for UniHuman and for ExpAll in Figure 2.2. For
comparison, we indicated background residue occurrences (dashed lines calculated as
averages for positions -25 to -30 and 25 to 30). The respective average occurrences in
the inside and outside flanks (calculated from an average of the values at positions -20
to -10 and 10 to 20 respectively) are shown with wide lines.
The “positive-inside rule” becomes even more evident in this normalisation:
Whereas the occurrence of positively charged residues is about the background level
at the outside flank, it is about two to three times higher both for the UniHuman and
the ExpAll datasets at the inside flank. To note, the background level was found to
be 1.7% (lysine) and 1.6% (arginine) in UniHuman and 1.4% (lysine and arginine) in
ExpAll. The inside flank average is 4.3% (lysine) and 4.6% (arginine) in UniHuman
and 4.2% (lysine) and 4.6% (arginine) in ExpAll. The outside flank is similar to the
background noise levels: about 1.4% (lysine) and 1.5% (arginine) in UniHuman and
about 1.5% (lysine) and 1.4% (arginine) in ExpAll.
Most interestingly, a “negativeinside depletion” trend for the negatively charged
residues is apparent from the distribution bias. The inside flank averages for glutamic
acid were 1.1% and 1.4% in UniHuman and ExpAll respectively; for aspartic acid,
1.2% and 1.4% in UniHuman and ExpAll respectively. Meanwhile, the outside flanks

for aspartic acid and glutamic acid occurrences were measured at 2.9% and 2.4%
respectively in UniHuman and, in ExpAll, these values for aspartic acid and glutamic
acid were found to be 2.5% and 2.1% respectively. Against the background level of
aspartic acid (2.8% and 2.9% in UniHuman) and glutamic acid (2.6% and 2.9% in
ExpAll), the inside flank averages were found to be about 2–3 times lower than the
background level while the outside flank averages were comparable to the background
level (Figure 2.2). Taken together, this indicates a clear suppression of negatively
charged residues at the inside flank of single-pass TMHs and a possible trend for
negatively charged residues occurring preferentially at the outside flank. This is not an
effect of the flank definition selection since the trend remains the same when using the
database-defined flanks without the context of the TMH (Figure 2.2). For UniHuman,
the negative charge expectancy on the inside flank doesnt reach above 2% until position
-10 (D) and position -11 (E), whereas, on the outside flank, both D and E start >2%.
The same can be seen in ExpAll where negative residues reach above 2% only as far
from the membrane boundary as at position -9 (D) and position -7 (E) on the inside
but exceed 2% beginning with position 1 (D) and 3 (E) on the outside (Figure 2.2).

The observation of negative charge suppression at the inside flank, herein the
“negative-inside depletion” rule, is statistically significant throughout most datasets
in this study. The inside-outside bias was counted using the Kruskal-Wallis (KW) test
comparing the occurrence of acidic residues within 10 residues of each TMH inside and
outside the TMH (Table 2.2). We studied both the database-reported flanks as well
as those obtained from central alignment of TMHs (see Methods). The null hypothesis (no difference between the two flanks) could be confidently rejected in all cases
(P-value<0.001 except for UniBacilli), the sign of the H-statistic (KW) indicating suppression at the inside and/or preference for the outside flank (except for UniArch).
Most importantly, acidic residues were found to be distributed with bias in ExpAll (Pvalue<3.47e-58) and in UniHuman (P-value=1.13e-93). Whereas with UniBacilli, the
problem is most likely the dataset size, the exception of UniArch, for which we observe
a strong negative inside rule, is more puzzling and indicates biophysical differences of
their plasma-membrane.

Amino acid residue distribution analysis reveals a general negative charge bias signal in outside flank of multipass TMH segments — the negative outside enrichment
rule

As a result of the rarity of negatively charged residues, any distribution bias is difficult to be recognised in the plot showing the total abundance (or alignment column
composition) of residues in multi-pass TMHs and their flanks from UniHuman and
ExpAll (Figure 2.3). Yet, as with single-pass helices, the dominant general leucine
enrichment, as well as positive inside signal, can be identified with certainty. When
the residue occurrence is normalised by the total occurrence of this residue type in the
sequence regions studied (shown as a relative percentage of at each position for multipass helices from UniHuman and ExpAll in Figure 2.3), the bias in the distribution of
any type of charged residues becomes visible.
With regard to the positive-inside preference, positively charged residues have a
background value of 2.0% for arginine and 2.2% for lysine in UniHuman, and 1.7%
for arginine and 1.9% for lysine in ExpAll. At the inside flank, this rises to 4.6% for
arginine and 4.1% for lysine in UniHuman and 4.6% for arginine and 4.2% for lysine
in ExpAll. The mean net charge at each position was calculated for multi-pass and
single-pass datasets from UniHuman and ExpAll (Figure 2.4). The positive inside rule
clearly becomes visible as the net charge has a positive skew approximately between
residues -10 and -25. What is noteworthy is that the peaks found for single-pass
helices were almost three times greater than those of multi-pass helices. For singlepass TMHs, the peak is +0.30 at position -15 in UniHuman and +0.31 at position
-14 in ExpAll, whereas TMHs from multi-pass proteins had lower peaks of +0.15
at position -13 in UniHuman and +0.10 at position -14 in ExpAll. Thus, there is a
positive charge bias towards the cytoplasmic side; yet, it is much weaker for multi-pass
than for single-pass TMHs.
Notably, a “negative outside enrichment” trend also can be seen from the distribution of the negatively charged residues, though with some effort (Table 3) as the effect
is also weaker than in the case of single-pass TMHs. We studied the flanks under four
conditions: (i) database-defined flanks without overlap between neighbouring TMHs,

Figure 2.4: The net charge across multi-pass and single-pass TMHs shows a stronger
positive inside charge in single-pass TMHs than multi-pass TMHs. The net charge per TMH
plotted at each position; the positive-inside rule is stronger in TMHs from single-pass proteins
than TMHs from multi-pass proteins. The net charge was calculated at each position as described
in the Methods section for the (A) UniHuman and (B) ExpAll datasets. Net charge for TMHs from
multi-pass proteins is shown in black, and the profile of TMHs from single-pass proteins is drawn in
blue.

(ii) flanks after central alignment of TMHs without flank overlap, (iii) database-defined
flanks but allowing overlap of flanks shared among neighbouring TMHs, (iv) same as
condition (ii) but only the subset of cases where there is at least half of the required
flank length at either side of the TMH. In UniHuman as calculated under condition
(i), aspartic acid is lower on the inside flank (2.3%) than on the outside flank (3.0%).
Glutamic acid is also lower at the inside flank (2.4%) than the 2.8% on the outside
flank (Figure 2.3C). Slight variations in defining the membrane boundary point do
not influence the trend (compare figures 2.3C and 2.3E). We find that, in all studied conditions, the UniHuman dataset delivers statistical significances (P-values: (i)
6.10e-34, (ii) 5.43e-41, (iii) 3.00e-57, (iv) 5.60e-41) strongly supporting negative charge
bias (inside suppression/outside preference; see Table 2.3).
Surprisingly, the result could not straightforwardly be repeated with the considerably smaller ExpAll. Under condition (i), we find with ExpAll that aspartic acid has
a background level of 1.0%, an average of 2.6% on the inside flank, and of 2.9% on the
outside flank but glutamic acids background is 1.2% but 2.8% on the inside flank and
2.5% on the outside flank. Statistical tests do not support finding a negative charge
bias in conditions (i) and (ii). Apparently, the problem is TMHs having no or almost
no flanks at one of the sides. Statistical significance for the negative charge bias is
detected as soon as this problem is dealt with either by allowing extension of flanks
overlap among neighbouring TMHs as in condition (iii) or by kicking out examples
without proper flank lengths from the dataset as in condition (iv). The respective
P-values are 2.05e-6 and 9.81e-15 respectively.

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

Table 2.3: Statistical significances for negative charge distribution skew on either side of
the membrane in multi-pass TMHs The “Helices” column refers to the total TMHs contained in
each dataset (ExpALL, TMH from TOPDB [Dobson2015]; UniHuman, human representative proteome; UniER, human endoplasmic reticulum representative proteome; UniGolgi, human Golgi representative proteome; UniPM, human plasma membrane representative proteome; UniCress, Arabidopsis thaliana (mouse-ear cress) representative proteome, UniFungi, fungal representative proteome;
UniBacilli, Bacilli class representative proteome; UniEcoli, Escherichia coli representative proteome;
UniArch, Archaea representative proteome; see Methods for details). In (A) the “Database-defined
flanks” and in (B) the “Database-defined viable* flanks” and the “Overlapping flanks” columns, the
“Negative residues” column refers to the total number of negative residues found in the ±10 flanking
residues on either side of the TMH and does not include residues found in the TMH itself. (A) In the
“Flanks after central alignment” column, the “Negative residues” column refers to the total number
of negative residues found in the 20 to 10 residues and the +10 to +20 residues from the centrally
aligned residues with a maximum database defined flank length of 20 residues. The total number of
proteins is given in the IDs column. The “Helices” column contains the total number of TMHs in
the dataset (n), the average number of TMHs per protein in that population (µ) and the standard
deviation of that average (σ). The KW scores were calculated for negative residues by comparing
the number of negatively charged residues that were within 10 residues inside and 10 residues outside
the TMH.
*Here, “viable” indicates that in each TMH used for both flanks either side of the TMH has a flank
length of at least half the maximum allowed flank length, in this case 10 (the viable length is 5)

The issues we had with ExpAll raised the question that, maybe, sequence redundancy in the UniHuman set could have played a role. Therefore, we repeated all
calculations but with UniRef50 instead of UniRef90 for mapping into sequence clusters (see Methods section for detail). We were surprised to see that harsher sequence
redundancy requirements do not affect the outcome of the statistical tests in any major way. For the conditions (i)- (iv), we computed the following P-values: (i) 1.31e-28
(5940 negatively residues inside versus 7492 outside), (ii) 1.38e-36 (5516 versus 7320),
(iii) 5.60e-53 (7089 versus 9233) and (iv) 4.18e-41 (4232 versus 5730).
So, the amplifying effect of some subsets in the overall dataset on the statistical
test that might be caused by allowing overlapping flanks (condition (iii)) is not the
major factor leading to the negative charge skew. Similarly, the trend is also not
caused by sequence redundancy. Thus, we have learned that the negative charge bias
does also exist in multi-pass TMPs but under the conditions that there are sufficiently
long loops between TMHs. Bluntly said: no loops equals to no charge bias. As
soon as the loops reach some critical length, there are differences between single-pass
and multi-pass TMHs with regard to occurrence and distribution of negative charges
and the inside-suppression/outside-enrichment negative charge bias appears. Not only
are there more negative charges within the multi-pass TMH itself (in fact, negative
charges are almost not tolerated in single-pass TMHs; see Table 2.1), but also, there is
a much stronger negative outside skew in the TMHs of single-pass proteins than those
of multi-pass proteins.

2.4.4

Further significant sequence differences between singlepass and multi-pass helices: distribution of tryptophan,
tyrosine, proline and cysteine

Amino acid residue profiles along the TM segment and its flanks differ between singleand multi-pass TMHs also in other aspects. The relative percentages of all amino acid
types (normalisation by the total amount of that residue type in the sequence segment)
from single-pass helices of the UniHuman (Figure 2.5A; from 1705 TMHs with flanks
having 68571 residues) and ExpAll (Figure 2.5B; from 1544 TMHs with flanks having
60200 residues) were plotted as a heat-map. The amino acid types were listed on the

48

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

Y axis according to Kyte & Doolittle hydrophobicity [Kyte1982] in descending order.
In accordance with expectations, enrichment for hydrophobic residues in the TMH,
for the positively charged residues on the inside flank as well as a distribution the negative distribution bias was found in both datasets. Additionally, the inside interfacial
region showed consistent enrichment hotspots for tryptophan (e.g., 7.1% at position
-11 in ExpAll, 6.2% at position -10 in UniHuman with flanks after central TMH alignment) and tyrosine (6.4% at -11 in ExpAll, 7.1% at -11 in UniHuman), and some
preference can also be seen for the outer interfacial region (e.g., 5.2% at position 11
for tryptophan in ExpAll, and 5.8% at position 10 for tryptophan in UniHuman) albeit the “hot” cluster of the outer flank covers fewer positions than that of the inner
flank. Further, there is an apparent bias of cysteine on the inner flank and interfacial
region (e.g., 5.5% at position -10 in ExpAll, 5.9% at position -11 in UniHuman), and
a depression in the outer interfacial region and flank (up to a minimum of 0.3% in
both ExpAll and UniHuman). Proline appears to have a depression signal on the outer
flank. Note that, in a similar way to Figures 2.2 and 2.3, the distributions of the flanks
derived from centrally aligned TMHs are corroborated by the distributions from the
database defined TMH boundary flanks (see outside bands in Figures 2.5A-D).
A similar heatmap was generated for UniHuman multi-pass (Figure 2.5C; from
12353 TMHs with flanks having 452708 residues) TMHs and ExpAll multi-pass (Figure
2.5D; from 15563 TMHs with flanks having 535599 residues). Whereas Figures 2.5A-C
appear quite noisy, the plot for ExpAll multi-pass TMHs appears almost Gaussian-like
smoothed, thus, indicating the quality of this dataset. Tyrosine and tryptophan in the
multi-pass case do not appear as enriched in the interfacial regions of single-pass TMHs
from both UniHuman and ExpAll. Prolines are only suppressed in the TMH itself and
are not suppressed in the outer flank as in the single-pass case but, indeed, are tolerated
if not slightly enriched in the flanks.

2.4.5

Hydrophobicity and leucine distribution in TMHs in
single- and multi-pass proteins

Generally, we see in Figure 2.5 that compositional biases appear more extreme in
the single-pass case, particularly when it comes to polar and non-polar residues being

Figure 2.5: Relative percentage heat-maps from predictive and experimental datasets
corroborate residue distribution differences between TMHs from single-pass and multipass proteins. The residue position aligned to the centre of the TMH is on the horizontal axis,
and the residue type is on the vertical axis. Amino acid types are listed in order of decreasing hydrophobicity according to the Kyte and Doolittle scale [52]. The flank lengths in the TMH segments
were restricted to up to ±10 residues. The scales for each heat-map are shown beneath the respective
subfigure. The darkest blue represents 0% distribution, whilst the darkest red represents the maximum relative percentage distribution that is denoted by the keys in each subfigure, with white being
50% between “cold” and “hot”. The central TMH subplots extend from the central TMH residue,
whereas the inner and outer flank subplots use the database-defined TMH boundary and extend from
that position. a TMHs from the single-pass UniHuman dataset. b Single-pass protein TMHs from
the ExpAll dataset. c TMHs from the proteins of the multi-pass UniHuman dataset. d TMHs from
ExpAll multi-pass proteins. The general consistency in relative distributions of every residue type
between single-pass and multi-pass of either dataset including flank/TMH boundary selection allows
us to infer biological conclusions from these distributions that are independent of methodological biases used to gather the sequences. The only residue that displays drastically differently between the
datasets is cysteine in multi-pass TMHs only. The most striking differences in distributions between
residues from TMHs of single-pass and multi-pass proteins include a more defined Y and W clustering
at the flanks, a suppression of E and D on the inside flank, a suppression of P on the inside flank and
a topological bias for C favouring the inside flank.

50

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

more heavily suppressed and enriched. To investigate this observation, we calculated the hydrophobicity at each sequence-position averaged over all TMHs considered (after having window-averaged over 3 residues for each TMH) using the Kyte &
Doolittle hydrophobicity scale [Kyte1982] (Figure 2.6A) and validated using White
and Wimley octanol-interface whole residue scale [White1999], Hessas biological hydrophobicity scale [Hessa2005], and the Eisenberg hydrophobic moment consensus
scale [Eisenberg1984] (Supplementary Figure 2.7). The total set of TMHs was split
into 15 sets of membrane-spanning proteins (1 set containing single-pass proteins, 13
sets each containing TMHs from 2-, 3-, 4-. . . 14-TMPs and another of TMHs from proteins with 15 or more TMHs). In Figure 2.6B, we show the P-value at each sequence position by comparing the respective values from multi-pass and single-pass TMHs using
the 2-sample t-test (Figure 2.6B). Strikingly, the inside flank of the single-pass TMHs
is much more hydrophilic (e.g., see the Kyte & Doolittle score=-1.3 at position -18)
than that of multi-pass TMHs (P-value=5.64e-103 at position -14). Most likely, the
positive inside rule, along with the interfacial clustering of tryptophan and tyrosine,
contribute to a strong polar inside flank in single-pass helices that is not present in
multi-pass helices en masse. Further, multi-pass TMHs cluster remarkably closely
within the TM core; the respective hydrophobicity is apparently not dependent on the
number of TMHs in a given multi-pass TMP. On average, single-pass TMHs are more
hydrophobic in the core than multi-pass TMHs (P-value<1.e-72 within positions -55
and P-value=5.92e-190 at position 0). On the other hand, hydrophobicity differences
between TMHs from single- and multi-pass proteins fade somewhat at the transition
towards the flanks (P-value=1.85e-4 at position -10, and P-value=3.35e-31 at position
10).
Leucine is the most abundant residue in TMHs (Figure 2.1) and is considered one
of the most hydrophobic residues by all hydrophobicity scales. Therefore, it plays a
very influential role in TMH helix-helix and lipid-helix interactions in the membrane
and recognition by the insertion machinery. When looking at the difference in the
abundance of leucine between the inner and outer halves, we find that TMHs from
single-pass proteins have a trend to contain more leucine residues at the cytoplasmic side of TMHs, particularly in the case of TMHs from single-pass proteins (see
Figures 2.2 and 2.5).

Figure 2.6: There is a difference in the hydrophobic profiles of TMHs from single-pass
and multi-pass proteins. a The hydrophobicity of single-pass TMHs compared to multi-pass
segments from the UniHuman dataset. The Kyte and Doolittle scale of hydrophobicity [Kyte1982]
was used with a window length of 3 to compare TMHs from proteins with different numbers of TMHs.
This scale is based on the water-vapour transfer of free energy and the interior-exterior distribution
of individual amino acids. The same datasets also had different scales applied (Figure 2.7). The
vertical axis is the hydrophobicity score, whilst the horizontal axis is the position of the residue
relative to the centre of the TMH, with negative values extending into the cytoplasm. In black are
the average hydrophobicity values of TMHs belonging to single-pass TMHs, whilst in other colours
are the average hydrophobicity values of TMHs belonging to multi-pass proteins containing the same
numbers of TMHs per protein. In purple are the TMHs from proteins with more than 15 TMHs per
protein that do not share a typical multi-pass profile, perhaps due to their exceptional nature. b The
Kruskal-Wallis test (H statistic) was used to compare single-pass windowed hydrophobicity values
with the average windowed hydrophobicity value of every TMH from multi-pass proteins at the same
position. The vertical axis is the logarithmic scale of the resultant P values. We can much more
readily reject the hypothesis that hydrophobicity is the same between TMHs from single-pass and
multi-pass proteins in the core of the helix and the flanks than the interfacial regions, particularly at
the inner leaflet due to leucine asymmetry ( Table 2.4)

Figure 2.7: There is a difference in the hydrophobic profiles of TMHs from single-pass
and multi-pass proteins. The difference in hydrophobicity between the single-pass and multi-pass
datasets stratified by number of TMHs is not due to the choice of scale. As with Figure 2.6, UniHuman
was stratified according to the number of TMHs in each protein. The mean amino acid hydrophobicity
values of TMHs with a sliding unweighted window of 3 residues from UniHuman proteins at each position were plotted. To validate the findings presented in Figure 2.6A, several scales of hydrophobicity
were used. (A) The White and Wimley whole residue scale [White1999] is based on the partitioning
of peptides between water and octanol as well as water to POPC. A positive score indicates a more polar score. (B) The Hessa biological scale [Hessa2005]. The hydrophobicity values represent the free
energy exchange during recognition of designed peptide TMHs by the endoplasmic reticulum Sec61
translocon and, therefore, negative values indicate an energetic preference for the interior of a lipid bilayer. (C) The Eisenberg consensus scale [Eisenberg1984] is a scale based on the earlier scales from
Nozaki and Tanford [Nozaki1971], Wolfenden et al. [Wolfenden1981], Chothia [Chothia1976],
Janin [Janin1979] and the von Heijne and Blomberg scale [VonHeijne1979]. The scales are normalised according to serine. A positive score indicates a generally more hydrophobic score.

This trend is statistically significant for TMHs in many biological membranes (Table 2.4, Figure 2.8). In the most extreme case of UniCress (single-pass), we see 49%

52

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

more leucine residues on the inside leaflet than the outside leaflet (P-value=5.41e-24).
This contrasts with UniCress (multi-pass), in which the skew is far weaker, albeit yet
statistically significant. There are 6% more leucine residues at the inside half (Pvalue=2.08e-4). The trend of having more leucine residues at the cytoplasmic half of
the TMH is observed for all datasets (both single- and multi-pass) except for UniArch
(single-pass). The phenomenon is statistically significant with P-value<1.e-3 for ExpAll, UniHuman, UniPM and UniCress (both single- and multi-pass). As with negative
charge distribution, UniArch presents a reversed effect compared to other single-pass
protein datasets with a 57% reduction in leucine on the inside leaflet compared to the
outside leaflet (P-value=7.25e-6). However, leucine of TMHs from UniArch multi-pass
proteins have no discernible preference for the inside leaflets (4% more on the inside
leaflet, P-value=0.625).
Table 2.4: Leucines at the inner and outer leaflets of the membrane in TMHs The
statistical results when comparing the number of leucine residues from the inner and outer leaflets
in each protein in the dataset. The number of helices per dataset can be found in Table 2.1. The
Kruskal-Wallis test scores (H statistics) were calculated for leucine residues by comparing the number
of leucine residues that were in the inner half of the leaflet with those in the outer half of the leaflet

A negative-outside (or negative-non-inside) signal is
present across many membrane types

We explored the presence of amino acid residue compositional skews described above
for human TMPs for those in other taxa and also specifically for human proteins with
regard to membranes at various subcellular localisations. Acidic residues for TMHs
from single-pass and multi-pass helices were plotted according to their relative percentage distributions (of the total amount of this residue type in the respective segment) for

Figure 2.8: Comparing charged amino acid distributions in TMHs of multi-pass and
single-pass proteins across different species and organelles. The relative percentage distribution of charged residues and leucine was calculated at each position in the TMH with flank lengths
of ±20 in different datasets. The distributions are normalised according to relative percentage distribution. Aspartic acid and glutamic acid are shown in dark purple and light purple respectively.
Leucine, the most abundant non-polar residue in TMHs, is in blue. Arginine and lysine are shown
in orange. TMHs from single-pass proteins are on the left and TMHs from multi-pass proteins are
on the right for different taxonomic datasets: a UniCress, b UniFungi, c UniEcoli, d UniBacilli, e
UniArch, and different organelles: f UniER, g UniGolgi, h UniPM. As a trend, the negative-outside
skew is more present in TMHs from single-pass proteins than multi-pass proteins (Tables 2 and 3).
Another key observation is that in single-pass TMHs there is a propensity for leucine on the inner
over the outer leaflet (Table 2.4)

five taxon-specific datasets UniCress (Figure 2.8A), UniFungi (Figure 2.8B), UniEcoli
(Figure 2.8C), UniBacilli (Figure 2.8D), UniArch (Figure 2.8E) and for three organellespecific datasets UniER (Figure 2.8F), UniGolgi (Figure 2.8G), UniPM (Figure 2.8H).
For single-pass proteins in all taxon-specific datasets (with the exception of
UniArch), there are more negative residues at the outside than at the inside. The

54

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

skew is statistically significant (see Table 2.2, P<0.001) except for UniBacilli. Despite
statistical significance found for UniFungi (P-value=1.12e-7 for database-defined and
P-value=6.79e-10 for flanks after central alignment; Table 2.2), however, the trend is
not very strong in this case (Figure 2.8B). Whereas the skew is just a suppression of
negatively charged residues at the inside flank for ExpAll and UniHuman (as well as
in UniCress), the bias observed for UniEcoli involves also a negative charge enrichment at the outside flank. In the case of UniArch (Figure 2.8E), we see a negative
inside preference that is 6.0% in the case of aspartic acid, and 6.3% for glutamic acid
(not shown), with much lower values close to 0% on the outside. Whilst the difference is statistically significant for both TMHs (Table 2.2) from single-pass proteins
(P-value=1.83e-12 and P-value=1.43e-11 for two versions of flank determination) and
multi-pass proteins (P-values 4.72e-3, 7.81e-3, 1.28e-4 for three versions of flank determination, see Tables 3A and 3B), the distribution along the position axis is heavily
fluctuating, maybe as a result of the small size of the dataset. However, one can assuredly assign a “negative-inside” tendency to the flanking regions of Archaean TMHs.
In the human organelle datasets, we see trend shifts at different stages in the
secretory pathway. In UniER, there is an enrichment of negative charge on the outside
flank of 1–1.5% that is comparable to the magnitude of the positive inside signal. In
UniGolgi, there is a suppression of negatively charged residues on the inside flank as
well as an enrichment on the inside flank resulting in ∼2% distribution difference. For
UniPM, there is a negative-inside suppression (but no outside enrichment) as well as
a positive-inside signal. All observed trends are statistically significant (see Table 2.2,
P<1.e-5).
For multi-pass TMH proteins, we see either the same trends but in a weaker form
or no skews are observed at all as inspection of the graphs in Figure 2.8 shows. For
datasets UniER, UniGolgi, UniCress, UniFungi, and UniBacilli, the hypothesis of equal
distribution of negatively charged residues cannot be rejected (P-value>0.001, see Table 3); thus, a skew is statistically non-significant. Although UniPM has a statistically
significant bias (P-value<4.30e-12, Table 3), the trends are more subtle and most
present for aspartic acid of UniPM. We see many more negative and positive charges
tolerated within the multi-pass TMHs themselves throughout all datasets (Table 2.1).
To note, there is a positive-inside rule for all multi-pass datasets studied herein.

2.4. RESULTS

55

To conclude, we find that negative-charge bias distribution is a feature of singlepass protein TMHs that is present across many membrane types and it can have the
form of a negative charge suppression at the inside flank or an enrichment of those
charges at the outside flank.

2.4.7

Amino acid compositional skews in relation to TMH
complexity and anchorage function

In previous work, we studied the relationship of TMH composition, sequence complexity and function [Wong2010, Wong2011, Wong2012] and concluded that simple TMHs are more probably responsible for simple membrane anchorage, whereas
complex TMHs have a biological function beyond just anchorage. We wished to see
how the skews observed in this work relate to that classification. Therefore, the singlepass TMHs from UniHuman and ExpAll were separated into subsets of simple, twilight,
and complex TMHs using TMSOC [Wong2011, Wong2012]. The relative percentages of eight residue types (L, D, E, R, K, Y, W, C; normalisation with the total
amount of residues of that amino acid type in all sequence segments considered) were
plotted along the sequence position for simple and complex helices (Figure 2.9). Of
UniHuman single-pass proteins, there were 889 records with simple TMHs and 570
with complex TMHs (Figure 2.9B). In ExpAll, 769 TMHs from single-pass proteins
were simple TMHs and 570 were complex TMHs.
It is visually apparent (Figure 2.9) that there are (i) stronger skews and more
inside-outside disparities in simple single-pass TMs than in complex single-pass TMs
and (ii) greater similarities between single-pass complex TM regions and those from
multi-pass proteins compared with simple single-pass TMs in comparison with either
of the other two distributions. To examine the statistical significance of these observations, we compared the amino acid distributions (K, R, K+R, D, E, D+E, Y, W, L,
C) across the range of TMHs with flank lengths ±10 residues using the KolmogorovSmirnov (KS), KW and the χ2 statistical tests. To note, the KS test scrutinises for
significant maximal absolute differences between distribution curves; the glskw test is
after skews between distributions and the χ2 statistical test checks the average difference between distributions. Calculations were carried out over single-pass complex,

Figure 2.9: Comparing the amino acid relative percentage distributions of simple and

proteins and TMHs from multi-pass proteins. TMSOC was used to calculate which single-pass TMHs
were complex and which were simple from ExpAll and UniHuman datasets. Simple TMHs are typically anchors without necessarily having other functions (Wong et al. [Wong2010]). The relative
percentages from single-pass simple (shown in light blue), single-pass complex (red), and multi-pass
protein TMHs (black) were plotted for (a, c, e, g, i and k) UniHuman and (b, d, f, h, j and l) ExpAll
for (a and b) positive residues, (c and d) negative residues, (e and f) tyrosine, (g and h) tryptophan, (i
and j) leucine and (k and l) cysteine. The slopes are statistically compared in Tables 5 and 6, and as a
trend, the profiles of complex TMHs are more similar to multi-pass TMH profiles than simple TMHs
are to multi-pass TMHs

2.4. RESULTS

57

single-pass simple and multi-pass TMH datasets from both ExpAll and UniHuman (for
P-values and Bahadur slopes, Table 2.5 (dataset UniHuman) and Table 2.6 (dataset
ExpAll)).
Many low P-values in Tables 2.5 and 2.6 indicate significant differences between
the three distributions studied. For the UniHuman dataset (Table 2.5), we find most
striking, significant differences between charged residue distributions (R, K, D, E) of
simple and complex single-pass TMH+flank regions (χ2 P-value<2.23e-3 for single
amino acid types). Similarly, simple single-pass TMH+flank segments differ significantly from multi-pass TMH+flank segments (KW test P-values<3.e-2 for R, K, D,
E, Y, W amino acid types as well as for K+R and D+E). The trends are the same for
the ExpAll dataset (Table 2.6): simple and complex single-pass TMH+flank regions
differ in charged amino acid type distributions (χ2 P-value<4.21e-3 for all cases), as
well as simple single-pass and multi-pass ones, do (KW test P-values<5.e-2 for R, D,
E, Y, W amino acid types and D+E).
Whereas P-value tests for significant differences between distributions depend
strongly on the amount of data, the more informative Bahadur slopes that measure the distance from the zero hypothesis are independent of the amount of
data [Bahadur1967, Bahadur1971, Sunyaev1998]. As we can see in Tables 2.5
and 2.6, the absolute Bahadur slopes for the simple single-pass to multi-pass comparison are always larger (even by at least an order of magnitude): (ii) for all
three statistical tests applied (χ2 , KS and KW), (ii) for all amino acid types, for
K+R and E+D and (iii) for both datasets UniHuman and ExpAll. Thus, complex
single-pass TMH+flanks have compositional properties that are indeed very similar to those of multi-pass ones (which are known to have a large fraction of complex TMHs [Wong2011, Wong2012]). This strong evidence implies that the actual
issue is not so much about single- and multi-pass TMH segments but between simple
and complex TMHs where the first are exclusively guided by the anchor requirements
whereas the latter have more complex restraints to fulfil.
Several distribution features of simple TMHs from single-pass proteins when compared to complex TMHs from single-pass proteins and TMHs from multi-pass proteins
that contribute to the statistical differences (Figure 2.9) are especially notable. There

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

is a more pronounced trend for positively charged residues and tyrosine to be preferentially located on the inside flanks and for negatively charged residues to be on
the outside flanks. The symmetrical peaks in the percentage distribution of tyrosine
in complex single-pass TMHs are more akin to multi-pass TMHs, whereas in simple TMHs the distribution resembles a more typical single-pass helix (compare with
Figure 2.2). Furthermore, the depression of charged residues within the TMH itself is
strongest in simple single-pass TMHs.
To emphasise, tryptophan is essentially not tolerated within the simple TMHs and
there are higher peaks of tryptophan occurrence at either flank. We also see a strong
inside skew for leucine clustering within the core of simple TMHs which is not present
in the “flatter” distributions of complex single-pass TMHs and TMHs from multi-pass
proteins.
There is obviously a cysteine-inside preference for simple, single-pass TMHs but less
in complex, multi-pass TMHs (Figure 2.9). This conclusion is contrary to a previous
study [Nakashima1992] but that deduction was drawn from a much smaller dataset
of 45 single-pass TMHs and 24 multi-pass TMPs.

2.5

Discussion

The “negative-outside/non-negative inside” skew in TMHs and their flanks is statistically significant We have seen that, consistently throughout the datasets, there is
a trend for generally rare negatively charged residues to prefer the outside flank of
a TMH rather than the inside (and to almost completely avoid the TMH itself); be
it by suppression on the inside and/or enrichment on the outside. The trend is much
stronger in single-pass protein datasets than in multi-pass protein datasets. However
as we elaborated on further, the real crux of the bias appears to be associated with
the TMH being simple or complex [Wong2011, Wong2012], thus, whether or not
the TMH has a role beyond anchorage. The existence of this bias has implications
for topology prediction of proteins with TMHs, engineering membrane proteins as
well as for models of protein transport via membranes and protein-membrane stability
considerations.

2.5. DISCUSSION

61

It should be noted that the controversy in the scientific community about the existence of a negative charge bias at TMHs was mainly with regard to multi-pass TMPs.
Despite having access to much larger, better annotated sequence datasets and many
more 3D structures than our predecessors, we also had our share of difficulties here (see
Results section III and Table 3). The straightforward approach results in inconclusive
statistical tests if datasets become small (for example, if selections are restricted to subcellular localisations, 3D structures or if very harsh sequence redundancy criteria are
applied) and, especially, if TMHs with very short or no flanks are included. Therefore
in the case of multi-pass proteins, we studied flanks as taken from the TM boundaries
in the databases under several conditions: (i) without allowing flank overlap between
neighbouring TMHs, (ii) as subset of (i) but with requiring some minimal flank length
at either side, (iii) with overlapping flanks. We also studied flanks after central alignment of TMHs and assuming standardised TMH length. Multi-pass TMHs (without
overlapping flanks) do not show statistically significant negative charge bias under
condition (i) but, apparently, due to many TMHs without any or super-short flanks
at least at one side. Significance appears as soon as subsets of TMHs with flanks at
both sides are studied. Not surprisingly, there is no charge bias if there are no flanks
in the first place. It is perhaps worth noting that the results from multi-pass TMHs
with overlapping flanks may involve amplification of skews since it involves multiple
counting of the same residues. Given the redundancy threshold of UniRef90, we cannot rule out that these statistical skews are the result of a trend from only a small
sub-group of TMPs which is being amplified. Hence, we also needed to observe if these
same observed biases were true in condition (ii), which is indeed the case.

As the “negative-outside/negative-not-inside” skew is widely observed among varying taxa and subcellular localisations with statistical significance, it appears to, at
least to a certain extent, be caused by physical reasons and be associated with
the background membrane potential.

Several earlier considerations and observa-

tion support this thought: (i) Firstly, a concert between the negative and positive

62

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

charge on the TMH flanks drives anchorage and the direction of insertion of engineered TMHs [Sipos1993, Hartmann1989]. (ii) The inner leaflet of the plasmalemma tends to be more negatively charged [Zachowski1993]. Specifically, phosphatidylserine was found to distribute in the cytosolic leaflets of the plasma membrane and it was found to electrostatically interact with moderately positive-charged
proteins enough to redirect the proteins into the endocytic pathway [Yeung2008].
The negative charge of proteins at the inside of the plasma-membrane would decrease the anchoring potency of the TMH via electrostatic repulsion. (iii) Thirdly
in membranes that maintain a membrane potential, there are inevitably electrical
forces acting on charged residues during chain translocation as this influences the
translocon machinery when orienting the TMH. Therefore, it is no surprise that we
see an inside-outside bias for negatively charged residues that is opposite to the one for
positively charged residues. The negative charges in TMH residues have been shown
to experience an electrical pulling force as they pass through the bacterial SecYEG
translocon import [Ismail2012, Ismail2015]. Also, they are known to be involved
in intra-membrane helix-helix interactions [Meindl-Beinker2006]. For example, aspartic acid and glutamic acid can drive efficient di- or trimerisation of TMHs in lipid
bilayers and, furthermore, that aspartic acid interactions with neighbouring TMHs can
directly increase insertion efficiency of marginally hydrophobic TMHs via the Sec61
translocon [Meindl-Beinker2006]. In support of this, less acidic residues are found
in single-pass TMHs, among which only some will undergo intra-membrane helix-helix
interactions. As the mutation studies have shown negative charge as a topological determinant [Nilsson1990], therefore, it is perhaps no surprise that we observe a skew
in negatively charged residues in a similar manner to the skew in positively charged
residues.
Whereas the “negative-outside/negative-not-inside” skew is observed for distantly
related eukaryotic species and it is also present in Gram-negative bacteria such as
E. coli, this sequence pattern was not observed for the Gram-positive bacteria in
which there is no observable bias. In contrast, Archaea have a statistically significant
“negative-inside” propensity both for single- and multi-pass TMPs. It is known that
Archaea have remarkably different membranes compared to other kingdoms of life
due to their extremophile adaptations to stress [Oger2013]. Whilst it is unclear

2.5. DISCUSSION

63

why negative charge is distributed so differently in UniArch to the other taxonomic
datasets, one must appreciate that a much more nuanced approach would be needed
to draw formal conclusions about Archaea, which current databases cannot provide
due to the relatively limited information and annotation of Archaean proteomes.
Methodological issues made previous studies struggle to identify negatively charged
skews with statistical significance
Whereas the influence of a negative charge bias in engineered proteins with
TM regions on the direction of insertion into the membrane was solidly established [Nilsson1990, Andersson1993, Kim1994, Andersson1992, Rutz1999],
the search for the negative charge distribution pattern in the statistics of sequences of TM proteins from databases failed to find significance for the expected negative charge skew [Sharpe2010, Baeza-Delgado2013, Granseth2005,
Pogozheva2013, Nilsson2005a, Andersson1992].
Generally speaking, the datasets from previous studies have been considerably
smaller compared with those in our work (only Sharpe et al. had a similar order of
magnitude [Sharpe2010]), especially those with experimental information about 3D
structure and membrane topology that we used for validation. And they might not
have had the luxury of using UniProts improved TRANSMEM consensus annotation
based on a multitude of TM prediction methods and experimental data, but this is
also not the major issue. We found that there are other factors that are critical for
observing sequence bias such as negative charge skew in the case of TMHs.
i Acidic residues are rare near and within TMH and biases in their distribution
are easily blurred by minor fluctuations of much more frequent amino acid types,
most notably leucine. Therefore, the method of normalisation is critical. We have
shown that normalising by the total amount of residues of the amino acid type
studied within the sequence region under consideration is appropriate to answer
the question where to find a negatively charged residue if there is any at all (called
“relative percentage” in this work).
ii The alignment of the TMHs is critical. It was common practice to align TMH
according to the most cytosolic residue [Sharpe2010] although it is known that
the membrane/cytosol boundary of the TMH is not well defined (and the exact

64

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE
boundary is even less well understood at the non-cytosolic side). Aligning the TM
regions and their flanks from the center of the TMH was first proposed by BaezaDelgado et al. [Baeza-Delgado2013]. Since we know now that acidic residues are
often suppressed in the cytosolic flank and within the TMH, this implies that the
few acidic residues found in the cytosolic interface would appear more comparable
to those in the poorly defined non-cytosolic interface as the respective residues are
spread over more potential positions, diminishing any observable bias.

iii We find that separation into single- and multi-pass TM datasets (or, even better,
simple and complex TMHs [Wong2011, Wong2012]) is critical to study the inside/outside bias. As many TMHs in multi-pass TMPs have essentially no flanks
or very short flanks if the condition of non-overlap is applied to flanks of neighbouring TMHs, this might also obscure the observation of the negative charge bias.
If there are no flanks, then there will be no residue distribution bias in these flanks.
The problem can be alleviated by either studying only subsets with minimal flank
lengths on both sides (although datasets might become too small for statistical
analysis) or by allowing flank overlaps between neighbouring TMHs.
iv This classification is even more justified in the light of previous reports about
the “missing hydrophobicity” in multi-pass TMHs [Nilsson1990, Hedin2010,
Hessa2007, Ojemalm2012].

Otherwise, the distribution bias well observed

among the exclusive anchors could be lost to noise. This addresses the more
biologically contextualised issue that there are different evolutionary pressures on
different types of TMHs. The negative charge skew is most pronounced for dedicated anchors frequently found with simple TMHs typically observed in single-pass
TM proteins. These TMHs are pressured to exhibit residue biases that may aid
anchorage in a topologically correct manner. Complex TMHs, typically within
multi-pass membrane proteins that have a function beyond anchorage, comply
with a multitude of restraints structural and functional constraints and the negative charge skew is just one of them.
The most representative precedent papers are those of Sharpe et al. [Sharpe2010]
from 2010 (with 1192 human and 1119 yeast single-pass TMHs), Baeza-Delgado et
al. [Baeza-Delgado2013] (with 792 TMHs mixed from single- and multi-pass TMPs)

2.5. DISCUSSION

65

and Pogozheva et al. [Pogozheva2013] (TMHs from 191 mixed from single- and multipass TMPs with structural information) both from 2013. Whereas the first analysis
would have benefited from the central alignment approach and the first two studies
from another normalisation as described above, the third study did come close to our
findings. To note, their dataset mixed with single- and multi-pass proteins was too
small for revealing the negative charge bias with significance; yet, they observed total
charge differences at either sides of the membrane varying for both single- and multipass proteins. Membrane asymmetry due to positively charged residues occurring
more frequently on the cytosolic side causes net charge unevenness at both sides of
the membrane. This observation has been known to correlate with orientation for
decades [VonHeijne1989, Baeza-Delgado2013, Meindl-Beinker2006]. Our data
shows that the negative charge skew contributes to this asymmetry.
There are differences in charged amino acid residue biases in TMH flanks through
each stage of the secretory pathway
Here, we observe differences throughout sub-cellular locations along the secretory pathway. We found that negative charges are enriched at the outside flank (in
the ER), both enriched outside and suppressed inside for the Golgi membrane, and
suppressed on the inside flank in the Plasma Membrane (PM). It has been suggested
that the leaflets of different membranes have different lipid compositions throughout the secretory pathway [VanMeer2008] and this has led to general biochemical
conservation in terms of TMH length and amino acid composition in different membranes [Sharpe2010, Pogozheva2013].
Lipid asymmetry in the Golgi and PM (in contrast to the ER) has been known
about for over a decade [Daleke2007, Devaux2004]. To note, the Golgi and PM
have lipid asymmetry with sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids on the non-cytosolic
leaflet, and phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine enriched in the cytosolic leaflet. Although the ER is the main site for cholesterol synthesis, it has markedly
low concentrations of sphingolipids [Bell1981]. Golgi synthesises sphingomyelin, a
lipid not present in the ER, but present in both the Golgi [Futerman2005] and in
the PM [Li2007, Tafesse2007]. The PM is also enriched with densely packed sphingolipids and sterols [Paolo2006]. Another factor influencing the sequence patterns

66

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

of TMHs and their along the secretory pathway appears to be the variation in membrane potentials [Qin2011, Worley1994, Schapiro2000].
Several sequence features can be assigned to anchor TMHs: Charged-residue flank
biases, leucine intra-helix asymmetry, and the “aromatic belt”.
We investigated the difference between TMHs from single-pass and multi-pass
proteins and found significant differences in sequence composition that are reflective of the biologically different roles the TMHs play. To emphasise and validate
these findings, we separated TMHs from single-pass proteins into simple and complex TMHs [Wong2011, Wong2012]; ones that likely contains mostly TMHs that
act as exclusive anchors, and another that have roles beyond anchorage. This leaves
us with “anchors” (simple TMHs from single-pass proteins) and “non-anchors” (complex TMHs from single-pass proteins, and TMHs from multi-pass proteins). If there
are strong sequence feature differences between anchors and non-anchors, it is likely
that the sequence feature has a role in satisfying membrane constraints to act as an
energetically optimally stable anchor.
Future studies in the area would desirably directly include a comprehensive analyses
of datasets oligomerised TMHs from single-pass proteins and ascertain if they appear
to be more similar to simple anchors, multi-pass, or generally neither. Currently, no
sufficiently complete set of intra-membrane oligomerised single-pass proteins exists
that can be compared to a large set of known non-oligomerising proteins. The current
work sidesteps this issue by comparing single-pass proteins with simple TMHs, which
tend to be simple anchors (as shown in previous work [Wong2011, Wong2012]),
against datasets that contain TMHs that will form intra-membrane bundles. Bluntly,
the simple/complex status of a TMH can be easily computed from its sequence with
TMSOC whereas the oligomerisation state of most membrane proteins still needs to
be experimentally determined.
Unsurprisingly, both positively and negatively charged residues can be seen to be
more strongly distributed with bias in anchors than non-anchors. Both the “positiveinside” rule as well as the “negative-outside/non-negative-inside” bias are mostly observable in simple single-pass TMHs (although they are statistically significant elsewhere). It is perhaps true that where a bias is clearly present in both non-anchors and

2.5. DISCUSSION

67

anchors alike, it is a strong topological determinant, whereas if the residue is only distributed with topological bias in exclusively anchoring TMHs, we can attribute these
features more specifically to biophysical anchorage. This being said, we should not
rule out that the same features aid topological determination since negative charge has
been shown to be a weaker topological determinant than positively charged residues
(35).
Tyrosine and tryptophan residues commonly are found at the interfacial boundaries of the TMH and this feature is called the “aromatic belt” [Sharpe2010,
Baeza-Delgado2013, Granseth2005, Nilsson2005a, Hessa2005] and this was
thought to be caused by their affinity to the carbonyl groups in the lipid bilayer [Killian2000]. Not all types of aromatic residues are found in the aromatic
belt; phenylalanine has no particular preference for this region [Granseth2005,
Braun1999]. It is still unclear if the aromatic belt has to do with anchorage or
with translocon recognition [Baeza-Delgado2013]. Here, TMHs with exclusively
anchorage functions showed stronger preferences for the W and Y in the aromatic belt
region, otherwise known as the water-lipid interface region than TMHs with function
beyond anchorage. This is strong evidence that the aromatic belt indeed assists with
anchorage, and is less conserved where the TMH must conform to other restraints
beyond membrane anchorage. Furthermore, we see that the tyrosine’s preference for
the inside interface region also appears to be to do with anchorage and this trend is
somewhat true for tryptophan, too.
Finally, our findings corroborate earlier reports that many multi-pass TMHs are
much less hydrophobic than typical single-pass TMH and about 30% of them fail the
hydrophobicity requirements of ∆G TMH insertion prediction (“missing hydrophobicity”) [Hessa2005, Hedin2010, Hessa2007, Ojemalm2012]. We also find that the
leucine skew and the hydrophobic asymmetry towards the cytosolic leaflet of the membrane is more pronounced in simple, single-pass TMHs than in complex or multi-pass
ones; thus, it appears to be another anchoring feature. It was found previously that
the hydrophobic profiles of TMHs of multi-pass proteins share similar hydrophobicity
profiles on average irrespective of the number of TMHs and TMHs from single-pass
proteins have been found to be typically more hydrophobic than TMHs from multi-pass

68

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

proteins [Wong2011]. Sharpe et al. [Sharpe2010] report an asymmetric hydrophobic length for single-pass TMHs. Our study reiterates the hydrophobic asymmetry
and attributes it mainly to the leucine distribution. The leucine asymmetry might be
linked to the different lipid composition of either leaflet of biological membranes.

Figure 2.10: Residue distributions of transmembrane anchors. A view showing additional residue distribution features that TMHs with an anchorage function display.a The
more classic model of a TMH showing the “positive-inside” rule [VonHeijne1989], the hydrophobic
core [Kyte1982], the polar enrichment that flanks the hydrophobic stretch [Baeza-Delgado2013]
and the aromatic belt [Granseth2005]. b Simple anchors may display additional features that conform to the membrane biophysical constraints: further suppression of charge in the hydrophobic core
(Table 2.1), intra-membrane leucine asymmetry that likely causes hydrophobic skew [Sharpe2010]
(Table 2.4, Figure 2.6), a higher preference for cysteine on the inside flanking region (Figure 2.9K
and L), a higher net “positive-inside” charge (Figure 2.4), asymmetric skew of the hydrophobic belt
favouring the inner leaflet interface (Figure 2.9E, F, G, and H) and a negative-outside bias via suppression on the inside flanking region or enrichment on the outside flanking region (Figure 2.9C and
D, Tables 2 and 3)

In summary, three key features can be assigned to aiding TMH stability in the
membrane (Figure 2.10): (i) charge, (ii) the aromatic belt, and (iii) leucine leaflet
preference. What is most novel here is that each of these features are furthermore
distributed with preference for a particular side of the bilayer in the case of anchoring TMHs. These differences in inside-outside topology that are most present
in anchoring TMHs further supports the notion that there are broad lipid compositional differences between the inner and outer leaflets of the bilayers [Sharpe2010].
Furthermore, while some TMHs conform and complement to the properties of the
bilayer, other TMHs with function beyond anchorage are less constrained to biophysically complement the bilayer. For these TMHs, any advantage gained by adhering
to the membrane restrictions is outweighed by more complicated protein dynamics,
topological frustration and protein functional requirements.

To conclude, the large fraction of functionally uncharacterised genomic sequences is
the great bottleneck in life sciences at this moment that hinders many biomedical and
biotechnological applications, some with tremendous societal need [Eisenhaber2012,
Kuznetsov2013]. Among these uncharacterised genomic regions, there is ∼10000
protein-coding genes, especially many membrane-embedded proteins. It is hoped
that the NNI/NO-rule as well as the other sequence properties of membrane anchoring TMHs described in this article will add new insights for membrane protein function
discovery, design and engineering.

Methods

2.6.1

Datasets

Databases.
All datasets used for analysis are listed in Table 2.1.

Transmembrane pro-

tein sequences and annotations were taken from TOPDB [Dobson2015] and
UniProt [TheUniProtConsortium2014]. UniProt derived datasets are the most
comprehensive datasets built with (i) robust transmembrane prediction methods providing the limit of todays achievable accuracy with regard to hydrophobic core localisation and (ii) subcellular location annotation that can be used for orientation determination. However, they mostly rely on predicted transmembrane regions. TOPDB
has meticulous experimental verifications of the orientation from the literature that
are independent of prediction algorithms [Dobson2015]. Unfortunately, this dataset
is much smaller with too few entries to have it divided with regard to taxonomy or
subcellular locations.
UniProt database files were downloaded by querying the server for different
taxonomic groups as well as different subcellular membrane locations; UniHuman (human representative proteome), UniCress (Arabidopsis thaliana, otherwise
known as mouse eared cress, representative proteome), UniER (human endoplasmic reticulum representative proteome), UniPM (human plasma membrane representative proteome), UniGolgi (human Golgi representative proteome).

To en-

force a level of quality control, the queries were restricted to manually reviewed

70

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

records and transmembrane proteins with manually asserted TRANSMEM annotation [TheUniProtConsortium2014]. Proteins were then sorted into multi-pass
and single-pass groups according to having more than one or exactly one TRANSMEM region respectively. TRANSMEM regions are validated by either experimental evidence [TheUniProtConsortium2014], or according to a robust transmembrane consensus of the predictors TMHMM [Krogh2001], Memsat [Jones2007], Phobius [Kall2004, Kall2007] and the hydrophobic moment plot method of Eisenberg
and co-workers [Eisenberg1984]. TMHs and flanking regions were oriented according to UniProt TOPO DOM annotation according to the keyword “cytoplasmic”. If
a “cytoplasmic” TOPO DOM was found in the previous TOPO DOM relative to the
TRANSMEM region then the sequence remained the same. If “cytoplasmic” was found
in the next TOPO DOM, relative to the TRANSMEM section then the sequence was
reversed. Proteins without the “cytoplasmic” keyword in their TOPO DOM annotation were omitted from further analysis.

The TOPDB database [Dobson2015] is a manually curated database composed
of experimental records from the literature that allow determination of the protein
topology. Experiments include fusion proteins, posttranslational modifications, protease experiments, immunolocalization, chemical modifications as well as revertants,
sequence motifs with known mandatory membrane-embedded topologies, and tailoring
mutants (Table 2.7).

Length cut-offs for the TMH were set at 16 as the shortest length and 38 as the
longest.

To note, we are aware that proteome datasets are a moving target that have dramatically changed over the years and, probably, will continue to do so to some extent
in the future[83]. Yet, we think that currently available protein sequence sets are sufficiently good for the purpose as we search for statistical properties in the TMH context
only.

The following datasets are used throughout this work:

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

ExpAll
TOPDB contained 4190 manually annotated transmembrane proteins at the time of
download [Dobson2015]. CD-HIT [Huang2010] identified 3857 representative sequences using sequence clusters of >90% sequence identity. This choice of similarity
threshold was chosen since CD-HIT ultimately underlies the clustering behind UniRef.
Unlike the other datasets, which by definition contain reasonably typical TMHs, many
of the transmembrane segments annotated in TOPDB are extremely short or long and
this would cause severe unrealistic hydrophobic mismatches. Especially, the short segments could be the result of miss-annotation, TMHs broken into pieces due to kinks
or segments that peripherally insert only into the interface of the membrane bilayer.
To remove the atypical lengths, cut-offs were set at 16 as the lower cut-off and 38 as
the upper cut-off after inspecting the length histogram. We found that, for the singlepass TMHs in TOPDB, 1215 out of 1544 are within the length limits (78.7%). Among
the 17141 multi-pass TMHs, we find 15563 within our global length limits (from 2205
TOPDB records corresponding to 2281 UniProt entries). This removed 1578 very
short TMHs and none of the long TMHs. Our cut-off selection is very similar to the
one by Baeza-Delgado et al. [Baeza-Delgado2013].
To get an idea of the taxonomical breakdown in the ExpAll dataset, the UniProt
ID tags were extracted and mapped to UniProtKB. The combined dataset of multipass (single-pass) proteins was mapped to 1288 (1343) eukaryotic records, 404 (776)
of which were human records, 926 (191) bacterial records, 46 (5) archaea records, and
14 (22) viral records.

UniHuman
This is a set of mostly human TMH-containing proteins or their close mammalian
homologues.

UniProtKB contains 5187 human protein records that are manu-

ally annotated with TRANSMEM regions (query = “annotation:(type:transmem)
AND reviewed:yes AND organism:“Homo sapiens (Human) [9606]” AND proteome:up000005640”. To reduce sequence redundancy, these sequences were submitted
to UniRef90 [Suzek2015]. To note, UniRef90 was chosen over UniRef50 to maintain
a viable size of datasets for statistical analysis of occurrence of negatively charged

73

residue, which are very rare in the vicinity of TMHs. 5015 UniRef90 clusters represented the 5187 sequences. A list of sequences representing those clusters was submitted back to UniProtKB resulting and 5014 representative entries were recovered.
There is a small issue in that the list of representatives from UniRef includes noncanonical isoforms, while the batch retrieve query of UniProtKB only supports complete entries, i.e. canonical isoforms. This resulted in the loss of one record at this
point is due to two splice isoforms acting as representative identifiers. Of those 5014
records, 4714 were records from human entries, 197 were from mice, 94 from rats, 5
from bovine, 2 from chimps, 1 from Chinese hamsters, and 1 from pigs. Although
the TMH length variations within the UniHuman dataset are much smaller than for
ExpAll, we applied the same length cut-offs for the sake of comparability. Out of
the 1709 single-pass cases, 1705 entered the final dataset. Of those, 1596 were from
human records, 87 were from mouse, 19 were from rat, and 2 were from chimpanzee.
Among the 12390 multi-pass TMHs, 12353 were included into UniHuman. The other,
multi-pass record identifiers were mapped to 1789 UniProtKB entries. 1660 of these
were human entries, 63 from rat, 61 from mouse, 4 from bovine, and 1 from Chinese
hamster. This clustered human dataset was then queried for subcellular locations to
make the UniER, UniGolgi, and UniPM datasets (detailed below).

UniER

The clustered UniHuman dataset was queried using UniProtKB for endoplasmic reticulum subcellular location (locations:(location:“Endoplasmic reticulum [SL-0095]” evidence:manual)). This returned 487 protein entries, 457 of which belonged to human,
24 to mouse and 6 to rat. 287 of these records contained sufficient annotation for
orientation determination. 132 were single-pass entries of which 120 records were from
humans, 11 from mouse, and 1 from rat. 155 were multi-pass entries containing 898
transmembrane helices. 144 were records from human, 8 were from mouse and 3 were
from rat.

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

UniGolgi
The clustered human dataset was queried using UniProtKB for Golgi subcellular location (locations:(location:“Golgi apparatus [SL-0132]” evidence:manual)). This returned 323 protein entries, 301 of which belonged to human, 19 to mice, 2 to rat and
1 to pig. 269 of these records contained sufficient annotation for orientation determination. 206 were single-pass entries of which 195 records were from human, 9 from
mouse, and 1 from rat. 61 were multi-pass entries containing 383 transmembrane
regions. 54 were records from human, 6 were from mouse and 1 was from rat.

UniPM
The clustered human dataset was queried using UniProtKB for the cell membrane subcellular location (locations:(location:“Cell membrane [SL-0039]” evidence:manual)).
This returned 1036 protein entries, 948 of which belonged to humans, 62 to mice, and
26 to rats. 920 of these records contained sufficient annotation for orientation determination. 493 were single-pass entries of which 451 records were from human, 37 from
mouse, and 5 from rat. 427 were multi-pass entries containing 3079 transmembrane
regions. 394 were records from human, 17 were from mouse and 16 were from rat.

UniCress
For the mouse ear cress, a representative proteome dataset was acquired with the query
annotation:proteomes:(reference:yes) AND reviewed:yes AND organism:“Arabidopsis
thaliana (Mouse-ear cress) [3702]” AND proteome:up000006548. This returned 3174
records in UniProtKB. UniRef90 identified 3111 clusters. 3110 of the representative
sequences were mapped back to UniProtKB. Of those, 3090 were from Arabidopsis
thaliana, 2 from Hornwort, 1 from cucumber, 1 from tall dodder, 1 from soybean
(Glycine max), 2 from Indian wild rice, 2 from rice, 2 from garden pea, 1 from potato,
4 from spinach, 1 from Thermosynechococcus elongatus (thermophilic cyanobacteria),
1 from wheat, and 2 from maize. Of those there were 1146 with suitable TOPO DOM
annotation for topological orientation determination. 632 of those records were identified as single-pass, all of which were from Arabidopsis thaliana. 507 protein records
were from multi-pass records, which contained 3823 transmembrane helices. 506 of

2.6. METHODS

75

those records were from Arabidopsis thaliana, whilst 1 was from Thermosynechococcus elongatus.
UniFungi
For the Fungi dataset, the query “annotation:(type:transmem) taxonomy:“Fungi
[4751]” AND reviewed:yes” was used. This returned 5628 records that were submitted to UniRef90. UniRef90 identified 4934 representative records, all of which were
successfully mapped back to UniProtKB. Of those, 2070 had suitable annotation for
orientation. 1990 records belonged to Ascomycota including 1243 Saccharomycetales.
73 were Basidomycota, and 6 were Apansporoblastina. 729 records contained a single TMH region, 702 of which belonged to Ascomycota, 26 to Basidomycota and one
to Encephalitozoon cuniculi, a Microsporidium parasite. 8698 helices were contained
in 1338 records of multi-pass proteins. Of these records 1285 were Ascomycota, 47
were Basidomycota, and 5 were Apansporoblastina. One TMH from UniFungi was
discounted from P32897 due to an unknown position.
UniEcoli
This dataset was generated by querying UniProt with “reviewed:yes AND organism:”Escherichia coli (strain K12)[83333]”” which returned 941 hits. The hits were
submitted to UniRef90, which returned 935 clusters. The representative IDs were
then resubmitted to UniProtKB, all of which returned successfully. 934 were from
Bacteria, whilst one were from lambdalike viruses. Of the bacterial records, 862 were
from various Escherichia species of which 565 were from E. coli strain K12, 28 were
from Salmonella choleraesuis, 25 were from Shigella and the rest all also fell under
Gammaproteobacteria class. This dataset contains 54 single-pass proteins and 3888
helices from 529 multi-pass proteins with sufficient annotation for topological determination.
UniBacilli
The Bacilli dataset was constructed by querying UniProt for “reviewed:yes AND taxonomy:”Bacilli””. This returned 5044 records, which were submitted to UniRef90.
2,591 clusters were found in UniRef from these records. The representative IDs were

76

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

successfully resubmitted to UniProtKB. 2031 of these were of the genus Bacillales
whilst 560 were also of the genus Lactobacillales. This dataset contains 124 singlepass proteins and 822 helices from 140 multi-pass proteins.

UniArch
The Archaea dataset was constructed by querying UniProt for “reviewed:yes AND
taxonomy:”Archaea [2157]””. This returned 1,152 records, which were submitted to
UniRef90. 1,054 clusters were found in UniRef from these records. The representative IDs were successfully resubmitted to UniProtKB. 946 records belonged to the
Euyarchaeota, 101 to Thermoprotei, 4 to Thaumarchaeota, and 3 to Korarchaeum
cryptofilum. This dataset contains 48 single-pass proteins and 59 multi-pass proteins
containing 327 helices from 59 proteins.

2.6.2

On the determination of flanking regions for TMHs and
the TMH alignment

The determination of the boundary point at the sequence between the TMH in a
membrane and the sequence immersed in the cytoplasm, extracellular space, vesicular
lumen, etc. is not that trivial as it initially appears. There is a lot of dynamics in
the TMH positioning and the actual boundary point will be represented by various
residues at different time points. Whilst the TMH core region detection from a sequence is trivial with modern software, the exact determination of TMH boundaries
remains difficult since it is unclear exactly how far in or out of the membrane a given
helix extends [Ojemalm2013]. Previous studies have dealt with this issue in various
ways [Sharpe2010, Baeza-Delgado2013, Pogozheva2013, White2008].
Here in this work, we explore two boundary definitions. First, we assign TMH
boundary locations as described in the respective databases. These flanks are the ones
that are reported in our TMH data files that are available at the WWW-site associated
with this paper. We studied flank lengths of ±5, ±10, and ±20 residues preceding
and following the inside and outside TMH boundaries. In these cases, the flanks are
aligned relative to the residue closest to the TMH.
In cases where the loops before and after the TMH are shorter than the predefined

2.6. METHODS

77

flank lengths, further precautions are necessary. In the multi-pass datasets particularly
(Figure 2.11 & Figure 2.4), the flanks overlap with other membrane region flanks. We
explore several variants. On the one hand, we work with data files where the flank
residue stretches are equally truncated so that no overlap occurs. If the loop length was
uneven, the central odd residue was not included into any flank. We find surprisingly,
that a large number of TMH has no or just a super-short flank, a circumstance that
should disturb any statistical analysis due to the absence of objects. Therefore, we also
work with alternative datasets (i) with flanks overlapping between consecutive TMH
(e.g., in Table 3B; yet, it leads to some residues being counted more than one time)
as well as (ii) with subsets of the data where the flanks at both sides have a defined
minimal length (50% or 100% of the required flanks; unfortunately, some of them
become too small for analysis).

Figure 2.11: The lengths of flanks and TMHs in multi-pass and single-pass proteins in
the UniHuman and ExpAll dataset.On the horizontal axis are the lengths of the TM segment
regions in residues. On the vertical axis are the percentages of the population. There are three
regions: the inside flank, the TMH and the outside flank. These regions are acquired according to
the TMH boundary of the respective database. Where no overlap is permitted, if the flank encroaches
the flank of another TMH, the flank length becomes half the number of residues in the loop region
between the two features. Where they are allowed to overlap, flanking residues may include other
flanks, or indeed other TMHs.

The problem of flanks overlapping does affect also some single-pass and multipass TMH proteins with INTRAMEM regions as described in some UniProt entries.
We do not include INTRAMEM regions in the datasets as TMHs but, sometimes, the

78

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

flanking regions of TMHs were truncated to avoid overlap with INTRAMEM flanking
regions (Supplementary Table S2). The identifiers affected for single-pass TMH proteins are Q01628, P13164, Q01629, Q5JRA8, A2ANU3 (UniHuman), P13164, Q01629,
A2ANU3 (UniPM) and Q5JRA8 (UniER).

The second form of boundary point definition for flank determination was achieved
with gaplessly aligning all TMHs relative to their central residue at the position equal
to half the length of the TMHs at either side. Though there is some length variation
among TMHs, most of them are centred around a length of 20-22 residues. In this case,
flanks are the sequence extensions beyond the standardised-length 21-residues TMHs.
We define the inside flanking segments as the positions -20 to -10 and the outside
flanking regions to be +10 to +20 from the central TMH residue (with the label
“0”). Instead of emphasising some artificially selected boundary residue, this definition
allows the average TMH boundary transition to become apparent.

2.6. METHODS

Separating simple and complex single-pass helices.

Single-pass helices from ExpAll and UniHuman datasets helices were split into
two groups:

simple and complex following a previously described classifica-

tion [Wong2011, Wong2012] to roughly distinguish simple hydrophobic anchors
and TMHs with additional structural/functional roles. Simple and complex helices
were determined using TMSOC [Wong2012]. The complexity class is determined by
calculating the hydrophobicity and sequence entropy. The resulting coordinates cluster with anchors being more hydrophobic and less complex whilst more complex and
more polar TMHs are associated with non-anchorage functions. In UniHuman there
were 889 simple helices and 570 complex TMHs. In ExpAll there were 769 simple
helices and 570 complex helices.

2.6.4

Distribution normalisation

In this work, we have used normalisation techniques described in previous investigations as well as new approaches designed to more sensitively identify biases of rare
residues. Baeza-Delgado and co-workers used LogOdds normalisation column-wise
in TMH alignments. Critically, this is based on their definition of probability, which
takes into account the total number of amino acids in the dataset as a denominator [Baeza-Delgado2013]. Since aliphatic residues such as leucine and other highly
abundant slightly polar residues dominate the denominator, the distribution of the
rare acidic residues will be easily lost in the “background noise” of those highly abundant residues. Pogozheva and co-workers used two approaches, (i) the total accessible
surface area (ASAtotal) and (ii) total number of charged residues (Ntotal ) as a denominator in their distribution normalisation [Pogozheva2013].
In this work, two methods for measuring residue occurrence in the TMH and its
flanks were used. Similarly to previous work, we compute the occurrence of an amino
acid type at a certain sequence position in a set of aligned sequences TMHs and their
flanks. Following [Sharpe2010], the absolute relative occurrence of this amino acid
type at the sequence position is then given by Equation 2.1 as:

pi,r =

ai,r
max(ar )
r

(2.1)

80

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE
Here, the denominator is the maximal number of all residues in any alignment

column (i.e., the number of sequences in the alignment) and, to emphasise, this will
make mostly dependent on the most abundant residue types. This type of normalisation reveals the most preferred residue types at given sequence positions.
Our second normalisation method is independent of the abundance of any amino
acid types other than the studied one; it answers the question: “If there is a residue of
type in the TMH-containing segment, where would it most likely be?” This relative
occurrence calculated in Equation 2.2 as:

qi,r =

100 · ai,r
ai

(2.2)

The value is the total abundance of residues of just amino acid type in a given alignment of TMH-containing segments (i.e., in the TMH together with its two adjoining
flanks summed over all cases of TMHs in the given dataset). Peaks in as function of r
reveal the preferred positions of residues of type i. The difference in and normalisation
is visualised in Figure 2.12.

2.6.5

Hydrophobicity calculations

Hydrophobicity profiles were calculated using the Kyte & Doolittle hydrophobicity scale [Kyte1982] and validated with the Eisenberg scale [Eisenberg1984],
the Hessa biological scale [Hessa2005], and the White and Wimley whole residue
scale [White1999](Figure 2.7). The hydrophobicity profile uses un-weighted windowing of the residue hydrophobicity scores from end to end of the TMD slice. Three
residues were used as full window lengths and partial windows were permitted.

2.6.6

Normalised net charge calculations

Charge was calculated at each position by scanning through each position of the transmembrane helices and flanking regions and subtracting one from the position if an
acidic residue (D or E) was present, or adding one if a positively charged residue (K or
R) was present. The accumulative net-charge was then divided by the total number
of transmembrane helices that were used in calculating the accumulative net-charge.
Thus, the charge distribution is calculated by:

Figure 2.12: Relative percentage heatmaps from the predictive datasets calculated by
fractions of the absolute maximum and by the relative percentage of a given amino acid
type.The residue position aligned to the centre of the TMH is on the horizontal axis, and the residue
type is on the vertical axis. Amino acid types are listed in order of decreasing hydrophobicity according
to the Kyte and Doolittle scale [Kyte1982]. The flank lengths in the TMH segments were restricted
to up to ±5 residues. The scales for each heatmap are shown beneath the respective subfigure.
All TMHs and flank lengths are from the UniHuman dataset. (A) The heatmap has been coloured
according to a scale that uses column-wise normalisations used in previous studies [Sharpe2010].
See Equation 2.1. As an illustrative example, we show how the value for E at position ±12 is obtained.
There are in total 91/22 Es at these positions in 1705 sequences; thus, the represented value is 0.013
at 12 and 0.053 at 12. Note that L is clearly a hotspot as well as trends for other hydrophobic
residues, I and V, as is to be expected. A positive inside effect can also be seen. (B) The heatmap
has been coloured according to the relative percentage of each amino acid type (Equation 2.2). Here,
91/22 Es at position ±12 are compared with 615 Es seen within the flanks and the TMH section
itself amongst all sequences in the alignment. So, the expectation of an E at position ±12 if there is
any E in the TMH + flanks region at all is 0.036 at 12 and 0.148 at position 12. With this type of
normalisation, not surprisingly, we see the positive-inside rule is hotter than in subfigure A. There
are also hotspots in the flanks for the negatively charged residues on the outside flank. The leucine
hotspot is no longer very pronounced, as the leucines are quite evenly spread over many positions.

Statistics

The inside/outside bias of negative residues was quantified by computing the independent KW and the 2-sample t-test statistical method from the Python scipy stat package
v0.15 python package [VanderWalt2011]. This test answers the question whether
two means are actually different in the statistical sense. For the leucine residues,
each TMH region was divided into two sections, representing the inner and outer
leaflets ( Table 2.4). For the hydrophobicity plot, 3 window values of hydrophobicity
were taken for each TMH at each position. The statistical analyses were separately
performed for single-pass and multi-pass transmembrane proteins. At each position,
the two groups were compared using the KW test.
The zero hypothesis of homogeneity of two distributions was examined with the KS,
the KW and the χ2 statistical tests. To note, the KS test scrutinises for significant
maximal absolute differences between distribution curves; the KW test is after skews
between distributions and the χ2 statistical test checks the average difference between
distributions. As the statistical significance value (“Pvalue”) is a strong function
of N, the total amount of data used in the statistical test, we rely on the (absolute)
Bahadur slope (B) as a measure of distance between two distributions [Bahadur1967,
Bahadur1971]:

B=

ln(P value)
N

(2.4)

The larger the absolute Bahadur slope, the greater the difference between the two
distributions.

Tail-Anchored Protein Datasets

Abstract

3.2

Introduction

Tail Anchor (TA) proteins are a topologically distinct class of intracellular proteins
defined by their single carboxy-terminal TMS with a cytosolic facing amino-terminus.
TA proteins are involved in a range of key cellular functions including protein translocation and apoptosis. Additionally, within the TA class of proteins are a set of vesicle
fusion proteins called Soluble N-Ethylmaleimide-Sensitive Factor Attachment Receptor
(SNARE) proteins. There is biomedical interest in SNARE drug delivery mechanisms.
SNAREs can fuse liposomes containing various drug payloads into the membrane.
TA proteins are integrated into the ER membrane by different molecular machinery than the co-translational proteins. These mechanisms include the Hsp70/Hsc40
chaperone system [Rabu2008], the TRC40/Get3 ATP dependent chaperone system [Johnson2013, Chartron2012, Wang2014],
The pipeline generates a list of singlepass proteins with a transmembrane domain close to the C terminal, that are not splice isoforms. A previous study by
Kalbfleisch et al. published in Traffic 2007 (8: 1687-1694) predicted 411 tail anchor
proteins [Kalbfleisch2007]. The tools developed herein are openly available for reapplication to other datasets. Notably, known SNARE transmembrane helices are
highly hydrophobic even compared to other TA transmembrane helices. We compare
Kyte and Doolittle hydrophobicity profiles of our filtered human protein list against
83

CHAPTER 3. TAIL-ANCHORED PROTEIN DATASETS

the profiles of previously known SNARE and TA proteins. This provided a list of potential SNARE proteins in addition to potential spontaneously inserting TA proteins
similar to cytochrome b5 which have the least hydrophobic transmembrane helices.
Tail-anchored proteins are a topologically distinct class of intracellular proteins
defined by their single carboxy-terminal transmembrane domain with a cytosolic-facing
amino-terminus.
Tail-anchored proteins are involved in a range of key cellular functions including
protein translocation and apoptosis. Additionally, within the tail-anchored class of
proteins are a set of vesicle fusion proteins called SNARE proteins. There is biomedical
interest in SNARE drug delivery mechanisms.
SNAREs can fuse liposomes containing various drug payloads into the membrane.
Notably, known SNARE TMHs are highly hydrophobic even compared to other tail
anchored TMHs [Kalbfleisch2007]. This hydrophobicity appears to be a determinate factor in the precise delivery mechanistic route that a TA proteins use for insertion [Rabu2008, Rabu2009], for which there is evidence demonstrating that are
several mechanisms [Rabu2009, Johnson2013].
Whilst most eukaryotic TA proteins are inserted into the ER.
Their studies have moved the focus of spontaneous insertion away from the loop
regions and onto the physicochemical factors of the TMH itself.

records

downloaded

from

SwissProt

via

UniProt [TheUniProtConsortium2014] (Downloaded 24–04–2018). 106149 TMHs
(TRANSMEM annotation) were found between 76953 records (annotation:(type:
transmem)ANDreviewed:no). This keyword is contained in a record according to
either experimental evidence [TheUniProtConsortium2014] or a robust metaanalysis of TMH prediction using TMHMM [Krogh2001], Memsat [Jones2007],
Phobius [Kall2004, Kall2007] and the hydrophobic moment plot method of
Eisenberg and co-workers [Eisenberg1984].

11141 of those records had only a

single TMH. 11110 of those TMHs were within the length thresholds of 16 to 30
residues (None of those had the annotation for splice isoforms according to NON_TER
annotation). 5548 of those had had no SP annotation (SIGNAL). 4332 of those had
annotation (based on TOPO_DOM annotation) that the N terminal was cytoplasmic.
615 of those had the TMH within 25 residues of the C terminal, the same threshold
used by Kalbfleisch and their coworkers [Kalbfleisch2007]. Running CD-Hit 4.5.3
on the WebMGA web-server [Huang2010, Wu2011] at 90% identical sequence at
90% coverage thresholds resulted in 443 representative proteins. This threshold was
chosen as a compromise between avoiding over-representation of a certain protein and
maintaining a viable sample size.
From this representative list, 46 were Archaeal, 66 were bacterial, and 320 were
Eukaryotic and 11 came from dsDNA viruses. When counting proteomes with greater
than 20 records, 49 belonged to the A. thaliana proteome, 48 to Mouse, 46 to the
human proteome, 24 to S.cerevisiae.
65 were annotated under the Mitochondrion location (query locations:
(location:"Mitochondrion[SL-0173]")), 157 in the PM (query locations:

82 in the Golgi (query locations:

TrEMBL Tail Anchored Dataset According to Filters
111425234 records were stored in the TrEMBL database at time of download (Downloaded 25–04–2018). 22107826 of those contained TRANSMEM annotation (annotation:

(type:transmem)ANDreviewed:no). 18053 of these were single-pass proteins. All of
these were within the length restrictions. 17973 of those did not contain a signal
sequence when looking for SIGNAL annotation. 5157 of those contained a cytoplasmically located N terminal according to TOPO_DOM annotation. 155 records had a TMH
within 15 residues of the C terminal residue. In those record’s annotations, no more
than 1 appeared in any given species, so they were omitted from the SwissProt list
sequence redundancy protocol to avoid representing a well-annotated record with a
poorly annotated record.
UniProt Curated List
A query for locations:(location:"Single-passtypeIVmembraneprotein[SL-9908]
") was used in UniProt which returned 2460 UniProtKB IDs; 463 SwissProt results and 1997 TrEMBL results. Running these records through CD-HIT at 90%
redundancy yielded 309 SwissProt records and 808 TrEMBL records [Huang2010,
Wu2011]. Of those, 987 proteins from 973 records (308 from SwissProt, and 665
from TrEMBL) had the TRANSMEM annotation indicating a bone fide TMH. No further
filters were applied to this list. Proteomes represented by more than 20 records
include A. thaliana (60 records), Humans (38), Mouse (37), and S. cerevisiae (31).
401 were annotated under the Mitochondrion location (query locations:
(location:"Mitochondrion[SL-0173]")) 39 from SwissProt and 362 automatically assigned in TrEMBL. 401 in the ER (query locations:(location:
"Endoplasmicreticulum[SL-0095]"), 98 from SwissProt and 303 automatically annotated in TrEMBL. 1 TrEMBL record (A0A1E5RT24) in the ER set contained an
“X” residue in the C terminal flank and was omitted from the analyses. Two subcellular location datasets had no automatically ascribed records and only contained
manually annotated SwissProt records; 37 in the PM (query locations:(location:
"Cellmembrane[SL-0039]"), and 82 in the Golgi (query locations:(location:
"Golgiapparatus[SL-0132]")).
Remapping Previous Dataset
189 of the 411 proteins from the previous study [Kalbfleisch2007] were successfully
mapped to 222 UniProtKB IDs using the UniProt mapping tools with the RefSeq

Calculating Hydrophobicity

Windowed hydrophobicity was calculated using a window length of 5 residues, and half
windows were permitted. Average hydrophobicity takes the total of the raw amino
acid hydrophobicity values and divides them by the number of amino acids in the slice.
Values reported in the results are based on the Kyte & Doolittle scale [Kyte1982]
which is based on the water–vapour transfer free energy and the interior-exterior distribution of individual amino acids.

Calculating Sequence Entropy

Sequence entropy, is essentially an estimate of the linguistic entropy of a string.
In the context of biology, it can be thought of as an estimation of the nonrandomness of a sequence. Sequence complexity can be used to analyse DNA sequences [Pinho2013, Oliver1993, Troyanskaya2002], and is a component of the
TMSOC z-score which can predict function beyond anchorage of a TMH [Wong2011,
Wong2012, Baker2017]. here we focus on the analysis of the complexity of a sequence in protein sequences.
Broadly speaking, the information theory entropy of a linguistic string can be
defined as in equation 3.1, and we treat the protein sequence TMH as a string with or
without its flanking regions.

H(S) = −
pi logs (pi )

(3.1)

i=1

Where H is the entropy of a sequence (S), and pi is the probability of a character i through each position (n) in S. This allows us to quantify the average relative
information density held within a string of information [Shannon1948].

Statistics

The null hypothesis of homogeneity of two distributions was examined with the Kolmogorov Smirnov, the Kruskal-Wallis, and the 2-sampled Student’s T-test statistical
tests. These tests were all ran through the Python SciPy stat package v0.17 python

CHAPTER 3. TAIL-ANCHORED PROTEIN DATASETS

package [VanderWalt2011]. To note, the KS test scrutinises for significant maximal
absolute differences between distribution curves; the KW test is after skews between
distributions and the student t-test statistical test checks the average difference between distributions.
Since the Pvalue is a product of a fraction of test statistics obtained from a permutated set of the samples, it exponentially increases as N increases; the P-value is
a strong function of N. We rely on the (absolute) Bahadur slope (B) as a measure of
distance between two distributions [Bahadur1967, Bahadur1971, Sunyaev1998,
Baker2017]:

B=

| ln(P value)|
N

(3.2)

The larger the absolute Bahadur slope, the greater the difference between the two
distributions.

A Comparison Of Up-To-Date Tail-Anchored Protein
Datasets

Here, we use two sources for TA protein datasets. One dataset is based on a previous
method [Kalbfleisch2007] to obtain TA datasets and consists of 9296 TMH residues
(13279 including up to ±5 flanking residues) from 443 SwissProt entries with 90%
redundancy removal. Another dataset contains the UniProt curated set of Type IV
membrane proteins again with 90% redundancy removal. This dataset contains 21119
TMH residues (28791 including up to ±5 flanking residues) from 987 UniProt protein
records.
In order to get an understanding of the consistency of the datasets, before removing redundant proteins, we compared these two datasets to a dataset remapped set of
proteins from a previous 2007 method [Kalbfleisch2007]. The S1 dataset was built
with an aim to gather TA proteins in the human genome from the NCBI. Note that
these numbers are not absolutely certain. The greatest source of uncertainty here is

set of human tail anchored proteins denote by S1 [Kalbfleisch2007], ii) the SwissProt dataset filtered

and iii) The UniProt curated list of TA proteins [TheUniProtConsortium2014]. Note that
to avoid losing IDs to redundancy reduction this diagram was generated without the use of CDHIT [Huang2010, Wu2011], which is applied in later statistical analysis.

that the original S1 list includes 411 records, however only 222 of these were successfully mapped to the UniProt dataset. This figure is closer to the 202 proteins from the
original S1 list that excluded proteins that were either hypothetical or splice isoforms.
That being said, this mapping step prevents us from directly comparing the entire
original S1 dataset. We compared the up-to-date datasets to S1 to see how many
records are shared, how many are now obsolete, and how many are unique.
Figure 3.1 shows that S1 has 175 record ids of 222 records (78.8%)

Of the 166 unique records of that

S1 dataset, 92 records do have location annotation in UniProt which our scripts use
for topological determination, leaving 74 records without location annotation. This
leaves 92 of the 222 S1 (41.4%) records that originally fitted criteria that no longer
fit those same criteria. If we exclude those lacking suitable annotation i.e ids from S1
that are found in either SwissProt with the filters (9), the curated UniProt list (14),
or both (33), compared to the 92 that have annotation contradicting the original
predictions, 37.8% of the ids overlap.

90

CHAPTER 3. TAIL-ANCHORED PROTEIN DATASETS
Equivalent criteria were applied to the entire SwissProt database and then re-

stricted to the human proteome dataset. 43 of these 77 records (55.8%) are in the
curated UniProt TA dataset leaving 34 records that meet the criteria out of the manually curated set (44.2%of the filtered SwissProt dataset). 42 of the 77 (54.5%) records
from SwissProt filtered human dataset can be found in the original S1 list. A further consideration is that, before limiting the dataset to human and after removing
redundant proteins, this method picked up 46 archaeal and 66 bacterial records.
The same method applied to an up-to-date dataset overlaps more with a manually
curated dataset. There is also a large degree of what we now believe to be mistakes
that occurred in the older prediction tools and datasets, even when using similar
methods. As a trend, this shows that up-to-date datasets improve the reliability of
this automated predicted method. These automated criteria still do not fully align
with the manually curated list. Only 973 of a non-redundant (90% CD-HIT threshold
[Huang2010, Wu2011]) set of those 2460 proteins of the UniProt manually curated
set contained annotation for the transmembrane boundary residues. Ultimately, this
points to the idea that datasets are a moving target as they are constantly updated
with more accurate and reliable tools.

It Is Difficult To Observe Hydrophobic Variation Of TA
Protein TMHs From Different Species

In single-pass proteins of eukaryotic species there are typically various adaptations of
the TMH to adhere to the membrane constraints of the specific membrane. For singlepass proteins, previous studies have observed differences in terms of TMH hydrophobicity between yeast and human TMPs [Sharpe2010], or in cress, yeast, bacteria, and
human datasets [Baker2017]. We would expect to see a similar trend between the
TMHs of TA proteins from different species. However, when assuming a zero-difference
hypothesis, in these TMH TA protein datasets we cannot observe any species-level differences between the datasets at this sample size for TMH hydrophobicity.
When comparing the average Kyte & Doolittle [Kyte1982] hydrophobicity values
for the TMHs from humans and mice, A. thaliana, and S. cerevisiae, we can see little
difference between the mean values. All of the mean values lie between 2.3-2.6 when

3.4. RESULTS

we only consider the TMH and at 1.3-1.6 when considering residues in close proximity
to the TMH (±5 residues) (Figure 3.2).

SwissProt automatically filtered dataset.

and the TMH±5 residues. Values are shown for both the UniProt manually curated set and the
SwissProt filtered set. In the UniProt manually curated set we compare the mammalian set of
TA proteins (Human N=38 and Mouse N=37) to A. thaliana (N=60) representing plants and S.
cerevisiae (N=31) representing yeasts. For the SwissProt filtered set we compare the mammalian set
of TA proteins (Human N=46 and Mouse N=48) to A. thaliana (N=49) representing plants and S.
cerevisiae (N=24) representing yeasts. Error bars are shown at ±1σ from the mean of the respective
dataset.

Indeed, we see no strong observable statistical differences in hydrophobicity (P >
3.35E − 1 in the SwissProt automatically filtered list Table 3.1, and P > 8.30E − 2
in the UniProt curated list Table 3.2). There are also no consistent trends among the
absolute Bahadur slopes; no datasets are greatly different from any other.
Here, we are dealing with datasets at least an order of magnitude smaller than
those broad studies [Sharpe2010, Baker2017] which could explain the absence of

There Are Biochemical Differences Between TailAnchored TMHs From Different Organelles

When we consider the TA proteins at certain locations within the cell ignoring species,
we see clear differences in the biochemistry of the TMH. In the UniProt manually
curated dataset, the Kyte & Doolittle hydrophobicity scores rage from 1.7 in mitochondria to 2.7 in the PM (Figure 3.3A).

the mitochondria (N=65). Error bars are shown at ±1σ from the mean of the respective dataset.

In the UniProt curated list, there are clear hydrophobic differences between all
the TMHs (P < 6.89E − 5) which as a trend becomes less clear when considering
the TMH±5 flanking residues except for mitochondria which increases in significance
when considering the flanks also (Table 3.3). The ER and mitochondrial tests are
very significant (P < 3.71E − 74). Consistently the Bahadur slope is at least an order
of magnitude greater in the ER and mitochondrial comparison than for the other
considerations, so these differences cannot be accounted for by the larger sample size.
In terms of sequence entropy, there is a marked lack of entropy in the PM subset (mean entropy = 3.12 in the TMH, 2.6 including ±5 flanking residues) from
the UniProt curated dataset compared to the other organelle datasets (entropy >

3.3 and > 2.8 including the flanks). However this stark difference cannot be observed in the SwissProt set(Figure 3.3). All considerations of disorder were significant
(P < 2.33E − 4)(Table 3.3). As a trend, the flanks obscure the differences between the
datasets, implying the differences of disorder are more clear within the TMH itself.
No clear significances can be observed for the sequence entropy (P > 6.33E −
2), but unsurprisingly as a trend the entropy mirrors the hydrophobicity albeit with
less range between dataset means (2.62-3.00 in the TMH for disorder, 1.72-2.74 for
hydrophobicity)(Figure 3.3).
Similarly, in the SwissProt filtered dataset the mean TMH hydrophobicity for mitochondria is the lowest at 1.9, but it appears to be the Golgi apparatus that is the
peak at 2.4. In the SwissProt dataset, when we compare each subset of only the TMH
to the ER subset, we find significance between the ER and the Golgi (P < 1.98E − 3),
and the ER and the mitochondria (P < 4.62E − 3), however the ER and PM are
more similar considering the Bahadur values are < 6.44E − 4, two orders of magnitude
smaller that the other sets (Bahadur values > 3.3E − 2) (Table 3.4). When we take
into account the flanks, the ER and PM dataset can be distinguished (P < 2.50E − 3),

however as a trend the other two comparisons, ER and Golgi becomes less significant,
and ER and mitochondria become more significant.
The linguistic sequence entropy of the TMH string as well as the GlobProt disorder
were also examined. Significance was found in disorder when comparing TMH between
ER and Golgi (P < 5.01E − 4) and the PM (P < 2.87E − 6)(Table 3.4), but there was
no observable difference between the ER and PM. No real significance was observed
in any consideration of the linguistic entropy, but similarly to the UniProt subset,
as a trend the entropy mirrors the hydrophobicity (Figure 3.3). This is unsurprising
given that the hydrophobic nature of the TMHs demands that certain residues must
be over-represented, which lowers the sequence entropy. In this case, we have a highly
hydrophobic set, the PM UniProt set, which likely contains a higher proportion of the
most hydrophobic residues.
When considering disorder, we see in both datasets that the Golgi subset is the most
negative at -0.2 with TMH and -0.25 with the flanks in both the UniProt manually curated and the SwissProt filtered datasets. Whereas mitochondria is the least negative
in both cases when considering the TMH (-0.14 in UniProt and -0.13 in SwissProt) or

Spontaneous insertion may be achieved by polar
patches in the TMH

There are a small group of tail-anchored proteins that have very polar transmembrane
domains and are capable of liposome membrane insertion without insertion machinery,
also known as spontaneous insertion, that are chaperoned by Hsp70/Hsc40 rather than
the TRC40 pathway [Rabu2008, Rabu2009, Colombo2009]. Chimeric synaptobrevin, one of the first identified SNARE proteins, is capable of spontaneous insertion
if the tail anchor domain is replaced by the TM domains belonging to a protein of
known spontaneously inserting domains.

Discussion

We expect to see evolutionary adaptations of TMH hydrophobicity to species specific
membranes, even within eukaryotes [Baker2017, Sharpe2010]. In this study using
both a manually curated dataset from UniProt, and an automatically filtered list
using SwissProt annotation, we do not observe any strong differences. Since we could
not scrutinise a difference in the species, the strong hydrophobic differences between
TMHs from different organelles may not be solely accounted for by adaptation to the
different membrane compositions. Given the large biochemical distinction between
TA proteins with different terminal destinations, it is possible to conclude that TMHs
contain necessary, yet cryptic, biological factors that play a role in their targeting. It is
indeed possible that our observations are adaptations to the membrane environment,
and this would not be unreasonable, except that TA proteins would be expected to
experience similar adaptations at a species level, for which at this sample size such an
effect is unobservable. This is almost certainly aided by other factors and is part of a
system with several redundant mechanisms.
This could indeed be a cryptic functional similarity to the signal anchored proteins.
Signal anchored proteins contain a single hydrophobic segment that serves as both a
mitochondrial targeting signal and a membrane anchor. Interestingly, these proteins,

along with some tail-anchored proteins, have been shown to be able to spontaneously
insert into the membrane independently from the translocon [Elisa2012, Lan2000,
Colombo2009].
The idea that SNARE proteins are modular and capable of spontaneous insertion has significant implications for both biomedical application in liposome-based
drug delivery and can aid future research for testing complex biological molecular
networks [Allen2013, Nordlund2014].

Discussion

GPCRs have long be known to be overrepresented among genomes [Remm2000].
Seen across a variety of 7TM families with varying functions with datasets built
from all membrane types (hence variety). Suggests a pressure for simpler TMHs to
precede more complex ones, repeating every 3-4 TMHs. The universality points toward
translocon behaviour pressure, or thermodynamic stability in the membrane. Would
we expect this behaviour if the translocon acted on only one TMH at a time?

Outlook
The hydrophobicity–sequence complexity continuum

We hypothesise that the hydrophobicity–sequence complexity continuum contains nuanced codes for different functions and that such differentiation of sequence and structural properties will allow assignment to these varying functions. Additionally, we
suggest probing functional classification of yet uncharacterised membrane proteins by
similarities of combinations of complex TM sets to well studied membrane proteins and
finding those classes of TM proteins where this principle is most directly applicable.
