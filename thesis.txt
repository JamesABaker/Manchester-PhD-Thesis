Investigating the Recognition and Interactions of Non-Polar α Helices in
Biology
July 4, 2018

11

Abstract
Non–polar helices figure prominently in structural biology, from the first protein structure (myoglobin) through trans-membrane segments, to current work on recognition
of protein trafficking and quality control. Trans-membrane α helix containing proteins make around a quarter of all proteins, as well as two-thirds of drug targets, and
contain some of the most critical proteins required for life as we know it. Yet they
are fundamentally difficult to study experimentally. This is in part due to the very
features that make them so biologically influential: their non–polar trans-membrane
helix regions. What is missing in the current literature is a nuanced understanding
of the complexities of the helix composition beyond a hydrophobic region of around
20 residues. Currently, it is known that the properties of trans-membrane protein α
helices underpin membrane protein insertion mechanisms.
By leveraging large data-sets of trans-membrane proteins, this thesis is focused on
characterising features of α helices en masse, particularly regarding their topology,
membrane–protein interactions, and intramembrane protein interactions.
In this thesis, I make the argument that there are different classifications of transmembrane α helices. These have markedly different evolutionary pressures, these
different classes interact differently with the membrane, and each class serve the protein
differently.

Lay Abstract
The survival of each of our cells relies on a a cellular barrier to separate themselves
from the surrounding environment. This cellular skin can be thought of as the bag that
contains all the important machinery required for normal cell function. The barrier
works by being chemically very different to both the outside environment, and to the
inside of the cell, which in both cases are mostly water. The membrane is fatty, and
because of that, the membrane repels water.
Proteins are the molecular machinery that form much of the cell structure and
shape as well as carrying out many of the cell’s routine tasks. Around a third of
our genome codes for proteins that are permanently embedded in the membrane, but
because these proteins are adapted for a life in the water repelling cell wall, they are
very hard to study in laboratories which often rely on methods that hold proteins in
water based solutions.
In this thesis, we focus particularly on the parts of the protein that are embedded
in the water repelling cellular skin. Traditionally, these regions are hard to study,
because we must first remove them from the cellular wall, which causes problems since
the embedded regions also repel water and this often causes them to stick to one
another, making them hard to work with in a laboratory setting.
We analyse thousands of proteins to further our understanding of electrical charges
in the embedded regions and find that negative charge on the outside of the cell has
been evolutionary selected across bacteria, animals, and plants. This is especially
true for regions that specifically anchor the protein into the cellular wall. Where the
embedded regions have additional function, for example ferrying something in or out
of the cell, the negative charge “bias” can no longer be seen.
This thesis demonstrates the radically different evolutionary story that transmembrane regions have compared to other proteins; the sacrifices they make for their stability in order to maintain their function, and their optimisation through evolutionary
timescales to become mould to the membrane as best they can.

Chapter 1
Introduction
Trans-membrane (TM) biology is a huge and varied field that is ultimately the study
of the interface between compartments of the cell; one of the fundamental pillars of life
as we know it [1]. Trans-membrane Protein (TMP)s include some of the most critical
to life proteins as well as a large number of drug targets. However, the experimental
inaccessibility of the TMH has hampered the progress of study compared to their
globular structural analogues. Despite progress over the last decade, the understanding
of the relationship between the sequence and function of a TMH is incomplete.
In this chapter we will place the TMH problem in context, then describe the important biological aspects of the TMH (the traversing Trans-membrane Segment (TMS)
as well as the membrane itself), and discuss tools and methods that allow us to analyse
and describe the nuanced differences between these TMH sequences.

α Helices; Structure And Function
Trans-membrane Helix Sequence Composition

Measurements of the TMH regions have found that they are roughly 20 residues in
length; 17.3±3.1 from 160 TMHs [2], 27.1±5.4 residues based on 129 TMHs [3], 26.4
residues based on 45 TMHs [4], 25.3±6.0 residues based on 702 TMHs [5], 24.6±5.6
from 837 TMHs [6], and 28.6±1.6Å to 33.5 ±3.1Å from 191 proteins depending on
membrane types [7]. There are a couple of reasons for this variation. Primarily is that
the boundaries of TMHs are extremely hard to precisely identify since it is unclear

exactly how far the TMH rises into the water interface region [8]. Secondly is that it
is emerging that different membranes have different thicknesses [9], and that this is
directly reflected in the hydrophobic lengths of the TMH [7, 10].

Figure 1.1: A cartoon showing the general components of the membrane and a typical
TMH. The example used here for illustrative purposes is the trans-membrane region of therein
(Protein Data Bank (PDB) 2LK9) [11]. Dark grey areas denote the area of lipid head groups. The
residues found in these areas are often described as flanking regions and are often in contact with
the aqueous interface of the membrane. The helix core is mostly composed of hydrophobic residues.
Although the regions labelled here generally hold true in terms of the statistical distribution of polar,
non-polar, and charged groups, it is by no means absolute laws and many proteins break these
“rules” [6, 7, 10].

From left to right: a typical and traditional TMH, an exceptionally long TMH, a
TMH that lies flat in the interface region, a kinked helix that enters and exits the bilayer on the same leaflet, a TMH that is not long enough to span the entire membrane.
These exceptional formations present a challenge for topology predictions of the loop
regions.
The language used to describe TMHs varies somewhat across the literature, primarily due to a changing understanding of TMH general structure and relevance to
function over the last 15 years or so. There is a general composition of a TMH despite
specific protein and membrane constraints [10].

1.1. α HELICES; STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

19

A study by Baeza–Delgado et al. from 2013 [6] looked at TMHs in 170 integral
membrane proteins from a manually maintained database of experimentally confirmed
TMPs; MPTopo [12]. The group examined the distribution of residues along the
TMHs. As expected, half of the natural amino acids are equally distributed along
transmembrane (TM) helices whereas aromatic, polar, and charged amino acids along
with proline are biasedly near the flanks of the TM helices [6]. It has been noted that
transitions between the polar and non-polar groups at the ends of the hydrophobic core
occur in a more defined edge on the cytoplasmic side than at the extracytoplasmic face
when counting from the middle of the helix outwards [6]. This is probably reflecting
the different lipid composition of both leaflets of biological membranes [6].
A previous study by Sharpe et al. from 2010 used 1192 human and 1119 yeast
predicted TMHs that were not structurally validated to further explore the difference
in TMH and leaflet structure by exploiting the evolutionary conserved sequence differences between the TMH in the inner and outer leaflets [10]. TMHs from vertebrates
and invertebrates were found to be reasonably similar compositionally. The differences in consensus TMH structure implies that there are general differences between
the membranes of the Golgi and Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). The abundance of serines in the region following the lumenal end of Golgi TMSs probably reflects the fact
that this part of many Golgi enzymes forms a flexible linker that tethers the catalytic
domain to the membrane [10].

The “Positive-Inside” Rule

Two publications by von Heijne coined the “Positive-Inside” rule demonstrated the
practical value of positively charged residue sequence clustering in topology prediction
of TMHs in bacteria [13, 14]. It was clearly defined and shown that positively charged
residues more commonly were found on the “inside” of the cytoplasm rather than the
periplasm of E. coli. More recently still large-scale sequence analysis of TMHs from
different organelle membrane surfaces in eukaryotic proteomes, show the clustering of
positive charge being cytosolic [6, 7, 10].

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

The Aromatic Belt
Tyrosine and tryptophan residues commonly are found at the interface boundaries of
the TMH and this feature is called the “aromatic belt” [6, 10, 15–17]. Not all aromatic
residues are not found in the aromatic belt; phenylalanine has no particular preference
for this region [16, 18]. However, it still remains unclear if this is to do with anchorage
or translocon recognition [6].
A study of conserved tryptophan residues during folding of integrin αIIβ3 TM
complex demonstrated the anchoring effects of tryptophan (0.4 kcal/mol contribution to membrane stability) in TMHs is greater than the other residues [19]. It was
suggested that it’s wide amphiphilic range (it’s stabilising energetic contribution in
either hydrophobic or polar sites) complements the heterogeneity and asymmetry of
mammalian membrane lipids in particular.
The Tyrosine side chain is a six-membered aromatic ring with an OH group attached. Tryptophan has two aromatic rings that are fused into one large hydrophobic
ring-structure. Phenylalanine, although aromatic, is completely hydrophobic, and
is found in the trans-membrane part rather than the interfacial parts of MPs. The
classical explanation for the preference of Tyrosine and Tryptophan to reside in the interfacial regions is their dipolar character. The side chain must simply seekmpromise.
This can be achieved by burying the aromatic ring close to, or within, the hydrophobic
core, while the hydrophilic part can interact with the polar lipid head-groups at the interface. Other factors such as the aromaticity, size, rigidity and shape of Tryptophan,
rather than its dipolar character, has also been suggested as the primary reasons for
its interfacial preference.
Snorkelling
Broadly speaking, TMHs are non-polar. However, some contain polar and charged
residues in the helix itself. Whilst this might seem thermodynamically unstable at
first glance, a molecular dynamic feature called the “snorkel” effect explains in part
how this is possible [20, 21]. Simply put, the snorkelling effect involves the long flexible
side chain of leucine reaching the water interface region to interact with the polar headgroups of the bilayer even when the α helix backbone is pulled into the hydrophobic
layer [22]. This has also been suggested to allow helices to adapt to varying thicknesses

1.1. α HELICES; STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

21

of the membrane [23]. More recently it was found that although in simulations the
energetic cost of arginine at the centre of the TMH is large, in vivo experimentation
with the Sec61 translocon reveals a much smaller penalty [24]. That same study
also found that in simulations, snorkelling, bilayer deformation, and peptide tilting
combined to to be sufficient to lower the thermodynamic stability penalty of arginine
insertion so that hydrophobic TMHs with a central arginine residue will readily insert
into the membrane.

1.1.2

Hydrophobicity of Trans-membrane Segments

Perhaps the most prevalent and important feature of the trans-membrane regions is
the membrane spanning region which is composed mostly of non-polar residues. More
recently the hydrophobic group region has been associated with cell localisation and
a broad range of biochemical functions [25, 26].
Over the last 50 years or so, there have been many attempts to use hydrophobicity scales of residues to predict structural classifications of proteins. Due to the
vast amounts of scales, major efforts have been made to compare them to identify
which ones are better for which tasks of identifying structural elements [27, 28]. Simm
et al. 2016 [27] compared 98 scales and found that the accuracy of a scale for secondary structure prediction depends on the spacing of the hydrophobicity values of
certain amino acids but generally that the methods behind the scales don’t affect the
separation capacity between β sheets or α helices.
Throughout this thesis, several scales are used to evaluate and estimate hydrophobic values of peptide chains. All the scales aim for quantifying the hydrophobic values
of each residue. There are several key differences in their methodology, assumptions,
and aims. Ultimately, all the scales are attempting to allow estimation of ∆Gwhf ;
the free energy of a folded helix (f ) from the water (w) into the membrane core (h).
This free energy measurement is regarded as being currently experimentally inaccessible [29].
Although as a trend most of the scales agree, because of the methodological differences, there are indeed variations of values even after normalisation. Due to these
discrepancies, it is preferable and typical amongst the literature to use several scales
to verify the observable trends resulting from interpretation from an individual scale.

22

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

Notably, one of the classic scales, Kyte & Doolittle Hydropathy Scale shows a striking
similarity to the modern Hessa’s ∆Gaa
app scale, and that generally the “better” scales
count proline as hydrophilic, and focus on helix recognition rather than amino acid
analogues [28]. In α helices from soluble proteins, proline is almost always a helix
breaker, and α helix prediction scales don’t even attempt to quantify a proline scoring
penalty. Several of the scales used throughout this thesis are outlined below.
Kyte & Doolittle Hydropathy Scale
A scale based on the water–vapour transfer free energy and the interior-exterior distribution of individual amino acids [30].
Hessa’s Biological Hydrophobicity Scale
This is arguably the most biologically relevant scale [28], and is often called the ∆Gaa
app
scale. The scale is based on an experimental method where the free energy exchange
during recognition of designed poly-peptide TMH by the ER Sec61 translocon occurred [15]. These measurements were then used to calculate a biological hydrophobicity scale. The original study reported positional variance in some residues and is
strictly valid only for residues in the core of the TMH. A more refined study quantified
the positional dependencies of each amino acid type [31].
White and Wimley Octanol – Interface Whole Residue Scale
This scale is calculated from two other scales; the octanol scale, and the interface
scale [32]. This scale is fundamentally based on the partitioning of host-guest pentapeptides (acetyl-WL-X-LL-OH) and another set of peptides (AcWLm) between water and octanol, as well as water to Palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC).
The Eisenberg Hydrophobic Moment Consensus Scale
The Eisenberg scale is a consensus scale based on the earlier scales from Tanford [33],
Wolfenden [34], Chothia [35], Janin [36], Wolfenden [37], and the von Heijne scale [38].
The scales are normalised according to serine [39]. The automatic TRANSMEM annotation currently used in UniProt is according to TMHMM [40], Memsat [41], Phobius [42] and the hydrophobic moment plot method of Eisenberg and coworkers [39].

Sequence Complexity

Sequence properties that can be analysed by bioinformatics, the sequence complexity
and hydrophobicity, of the TMH have been used to predict the role of the TMH as
either functional or structural, and as a discrete cluster from other SCOP annotated
helices [26]. Those findings demonstrated that the sequence of the TMH holds valuable
information regarding biological roles, and forms the basis of our interest in the link
between the polarity of a helix and functional activity beyond structural anchorage.
TMSOC’s z-score is able to distinguish between functionally active TMHs and those
only associated with anchorage [26]. The z-score is a product of both hydrophobicity
and a Shannon like sequence entropy of the character string in the TMH. This term
is described below in equation 1.1.
"

Where xc and xΦ are moving window averages of c, the sequence entropy [43]. Φ
is the White and Wimley hydrophobicity [32] for a given segment and µ and σ are
the mean and standard deviation of the sequence entropy and hydrophobicity of the
functional TMH set, that is those TMHs containing active residues.
Sequence entropy, is essentially an estimate of the linguistic entropy of a string.
In the context of biology can be thought of as an estimation of the non-randomness
of a sequence. Sequence complexity can be used to analyse DNA sequences [44–46],
however here we will focus on the analysis of the complexity of a sequence in protein
sequences.
Broadly speaking, the information theory entropy of a linguistic string can be
defined as in equation 1.2.

Where H is the entropy of a sequence (S), and pi is the probability of a character i through each position (n) in S. This allows us to quantify the average relative
information density held within a string of information [47].
The compositional complexity is measured over sequence windows. If we have an
amino acid composition {ni }i = min i, . . . , max i with a window length of L = Σni ,

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

the total number of sequences can be calculated by dividing a factorial of the length
by the product of the compositions, i.e N = L!/Πni possible sequences. The SEG
algorithm [43, 48] identifies sub-segments of the raw region which have the lowest
probability. The algorithm searches for and concatenates sub-threshold segments for

1.2.1

α Helices In Membranes
The Transmembrane Protein Problem

Because of the experimental hindrance, TMP biology has been relatively slow to
emerge. Throughout the 1990s the concept of a TMH was simple and fairly assured:
they were greasy peptides of around 30Å in length, often bundled together and oriented perpendicularly to the membrane. By 2006, crystallography had elucidated
more than 60 high-resolution structures. Although the classic TMH structures were
broadly prevalent, these structures contained a plethora of unusual TMHs. TMSs are
capable of partial spanning of the membrane, spanning using oblique angles, and even
lying flat on the membrane surface [8, 49]; the classical model was incomplete. Even
recently, there is a contingency in the membrane biology field that despite progress
over the last decade there is still a lack of information regarding the relationship between TMH sequences and function, TMH structure, intra-membrane TMP assembly,
and the behaviour of TMHs in the lipid bilayer; the native biological environment of
TMHs [1].
Furthermore, the insertion and formation of the unusually orientated TMHs and
of the more traditional TMHs have been shown to be underpinned by complex thermodynamic equilibrium and electrostatic interactions [29, 50, 51]. As well as being a
biophysically convoluted system, TMHs are biologically functional beyond anchorage

1.2. α HELICES IN MEMBRANES

25

in many cases. TMSs have been identified as regulators of protein quality control and
trafficking mechanisms, shifting the idea away from TMHs broadly exclusively functioning as anchors [52], and crucially this function beyond anchorage can be revealed
by sensitive, careful analysis of the sequence information alone [26].
When predicting the function of any protein, one follows the dicta that function
is facilitated by form, and form is determined by the sequence; the more similar the
sequences, the more likely that the function is similar. For globular soluble proteins having the same folds induces strict biochemical restrictions on the packing of a
hydrophobic protein core which requires similarity of non-polar residue patterns. Sequence analysis of non-globular TMPs has not been studied to nearly the same extent
yet homology paradigms are silently extended and applied to them. In the case of Signal Peptide (SP)s or TMSs the physical constraints are similar for all TMPs, and so
matching is indeed merely a reflection of the physical environment of the bilayer, not
the common ancestry. Worryingly, because of this oversight, it appears that between
2.1% and 13.6% of Pfam hits for SPs or TMSs are indeed false positive results [53].
Over the last decade, Nanodiscs have been routinely used to much more easily
obtain crystal structures. Nanodiscs overcome some of the major challenges caused by
the hydrophobic helices and a more faithful representation of the biological membranes
than alternative model membranes like liposomes [54].
However, critical questions remain: How is the TMH oriented in the membrane,
how is the TMH interacting with the membrane, how is the TMH interacting with
another TMH in the membrane, does the TMH have functions beyond anchorage and
if so what are they?

1.2.2

The Importance Of Transmembrane Proteins

Membrane-bound proteins underpin almost every biological process directly, or indirectly, from photosynthesis to respiration. Integral TMP are encoded by between a
third to a half of the genes in the human genome which reflects their biological importance [55–57]. These proteins allow biochemical pathways that traverse the various
biological membranes used in life.
The relationship between the membrane and TMPs is underpinned by complex
thermodynamic and electrostatic equilibrium. Once inserted the protein doesn’t leave

26

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

the membrane as a result of the TMH being very hydrophobic. This hydrophobicity
and the hydrophobicity of the lipid tails means that they self-associate and this association is entropically driven by water. Another way of describing it is that they
fiercely dissociate from the water. The overall ∆G for a TMH in the membrane is
-12kcalmol−1 [29]; the association of the helix in the membrane is typically spontaneous.

1.3

Biological Membrane Composition

”before we discuss the membrane proteins, one must consider the biological reason
as for why they exist.” The outline that MPs are vital for relaying information and
chemistry across the membrane.

1.3.1

Lipids of the Membrane

The compartmentalisation of cellular biochemistry is arguably one of the most significant events to have occurred in evolution and is certainly one of the fundamental
prerequisites for life [58]. The proteins that allow life to use this biochemical barrier
are perhaps equally important. Together, the lipid bilayer and proteins therein allow
complex biochemical systems that facilitate life as we know it.
It is critical to understand that the lipid bilayer and the trans-membrane α helices are inextricably linked, and often what we observe from the α helices reflect the
properties of the much harder to study membranes. The lipid membranes influence
the local structure, dynamics, and activity of proteins in the membrane in non-trivial
ways [59–66], as well as protein folding [67].
There is a rich variety of lipid molecules that make up the biological membranes.
The majority of lipids in higher organism membranes are phospholipids, sphingolipids,
and sterols. These are composed of a glycerol molecule. Bonded to the glycerol
molecule are two hydrophobic fatty acid tail groups and a negatively-charged polar
phosphate group. The polar phosphate group is modified with an alcohol group. Water
entropically drives the self-association of the lipid molecules. In other words, the
bilayer forms from these phospholipid molecules due to the fierce dissociation between
the polar water and the hydrophobic tails. Furthermore, the bilayer maximises van der

1.3. BIOLOGICAL MEMBRANE COMPOSITION

27

Waals interactions between the closely-packed hydrocarbon chains, which contributes
to the stability of the bilayer. This can be seen even in relatively early Molecular
Dynamics (MD) simulations [68].

Differences in Membrane Compositions
It has been known for some time that the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria are asymmetric in terms of lipid composition. The outer membranes contain
lipopolysaccharide, whilst the inner is a mixture of approximately 25 phospholipid
types. Adding to the membrane asymmetry composition story, a thorough analysis of
residue composition in yeast and human TMH regions revealed intra-membrane leaflet
composition asymmetry in the ER, but not the Golgi [10]. Furthermore, proteinlipid interactions have been shown to be determinants of membrane curvature [65],
and undertake complex orientations and conformations to allow for hydrophobic mismatch [69]. It may need changing with every bib.tex update unless the permanent
record is changed.

1.3.2

Membrane Potential

Simply put, membrane potential is the voltage across a membrane. If the membrane
is permeable to a certain type of ion, then the ion will experience an electrical pulling
force during the diffusion process that pulls toward the “preferred” biological location.
This clearly depends on a chemical component involving both the charge and ion
concentration gradient.There are various ways of estimating the membrane potential
ab initio.
The Nernst equation can be derived directly from the simplified thermodynamic
principles (i) the Boltzmann distribution, and (ii) a field charge interaction energy [70].
It is defined as:

Em =

RT
cout
× ln
F
cin

(1.4)

Where charge Em is the membrane potential, z is the ion charge, c is the concentration of an ion in that cell environment.
One problem in a biological membranes is that the compartments always involve

28

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

multiple ion channels. The Goldman equation aims to solve this problem by accounting for several ions that contribute to cout and cin (such as K + , N a+ , and Cl− )
simultaneously:
RT
Em =
× ln
F



pK + · [K + ]out + pN a+ · [N a+ ]out + pCl− · [Cl− ]in
pK + · [K + ]in + pN a+ · [N a+ ]in + pCl− · [Cl− ]out


(1.5)

Where charge Em is the membrane potential, z is the ion charge, [i] is the ion
concentration and pi is the relative membrane permeability for the actual ion.
However, it is rife with caveats caused by the assumptions of the simplified model.
Such assumptions include ions having point charge, that the potential is constant
throughout the solution. This is compounded because it assumes the constant potential is the same as the point of measurement which can be heavily influenced by,
for example, a specific adsorption of either part of the redox pair or the competitive
adsorption of a supporting ion in solution [70]. Therefore one should be cautious to
understand the limitations and variability when extrapolating experimentally determined E0 , particularly when using such an idealised model in a biological context.
Organelle Membrane Potentials
Several studies have attempted to quantify the various voltages across the intracellular
membranes. Negativity was found in the ER, with a voltage between between 75mV
to 95mV in the ER membrane [71, 72]. Negativity was found in the mitochondrial
matrix with a voltage across the mitochondrial membrane at 150mV [73]. No notable
membrane potential has been identified in the Golgi [74, 75].

Biogenesis of Trans-membrane Proteins
Translocation Overview

There are, broadly speaking, 3 types of translocation; BiP-mediated eukaryotic posttranslational translocation, bacterial post-translational insertion using the Tat system
for folded proteins and the Sec system for unfolded proteins, and co-translational insertion in bacteria through the Holotranslocon (HTL) protein complex or its individual
components.

1.5. AIMS OF THIS THESIS.

29

Translocation is when a ribosome translates the Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) to a
nascent peptide chain which is handed directly or indirectly to insertion machinery
which threads the chain through and, in the case of TMHs, releases the TMH into the
membrane environment.

1.4.2

Co-Translational Translocation

The overwhelming majority of TMPs use the co-translational method of translocation.
It has long been understood that this method is essentially the Signal Recognition
Particle (SRP) recognising and attaching to the nascent peptide chain whilst it is still
associated with the ribosome, and the SRP then targets the peptide and ribosome
to a Signal Recognition Particle Receptor (SR) in association with some membrane
insertion machinery on the ER [15, 76].
Crystal structures showed the SRP targets the nascent peptide chain for membrane insertion via a GTPase in both the SRP and SR, that is initially associated
with the translocon machinery, coming together to form a complex thus bringing the
nascent peptide chain in proximity to the translocon [77]. Mutant studies ofSRP [77]
revealed key discrete conformational stages. These are the specific recognition of signal sequences on cargo proteins, the targeting of the package to the membrane, the
handing over of the cargo to the translocation machinery all the while maintaining
precise spatial and temporal coordination of each molecular event [78].

The “Negative-Outside” Rule
The description of a TMH remains incomplete. The understanding of TMP topology is erroneous, and despite a wealth of structures, the general model of helix-helix
and helix-lipid interactions remains speculative and requires a great deal of intensive
analysis to generate a working model of a particular TMP.
The work presented in this chapter is an expanded version of published work [79].
We use advanced statistical analysis to analyse large sequence datasets that have rich
topological annotation. By analysing these sequences in the context of anchorage,
we find that some TMHs are confined to biological constraints of the membrane,
whereas others that likely contain function beyond anchorage, are less conforming to
the membrane. Specifically, there is further elaboration of statistical definitions in the
methods than in the published paper.

Abstract

Summary

As the idea of positive residues inside the cytoplasm emerged during the late 1980s,
so did the idea of negative residues working in concert with TMH orientation. It was
shown that removing a single lysine residue reversed the topology of a model erichia
coli protein, whereas much higher numbers of negatively charged residues are needed
to reverse topology [80]. One would also expect to see a skew in negatively charged
distribution if a cooperation between oppositely charged residues orientated a TMH,
30

2.3. INTRODUCTION

31

however there is no conclusive evidence in the literature for an opposing negatively
charged skew [6, 7, 10, 16, 17]. However, in E. coli negative residues do experience
electrical pulling forces when travelling through the SecYEG translocon indicating
that negative charges are biologically relevant [51]. In this chapter, we explore the
literature surrounding charged residue distribution in the TMH, and demonstrate that
the “negative-outside” skew exists in anchoring TMHs

2.3

Introduction

Two decades ago, the classic concept of a TMH was a rather simple story: Typical TMPs were thought to be anchored in the membrane by membrane-spanning bundles of non-polar α–helices of roughly 20 residues length, with a consistent orientation
of being perpendicular to the membrane surface. Although this is broadly true, hundreds of high quality membrane structures have elucidated that membrane-embedded
helices can adopt a plethora of lengths and orientations within the membrane. They
are capable of just partial spanning of the membrane, spanning using oblique angles,
and even lying flat on the membrane surface [8, 49]. The insertion and formation
of the TMHs follow a complex thermodynamic equilibrium [29, 81, 82]. From the
biological function point of view, many TMHs have multiple roles besides being just
hydrophobic anchors; for example, certain TMHs have been identified as regulators of
protein quality control and trafficking mechanisms [52]. As these additional biological
functions are mirrored in the TMHs sequence patterns, TMHs can be classified as
simple (just hydrophobic anchors) and complex sequence segments [26, 53, 83].
The relationship between sequence patterns in and in the vicinity of TMHs and
their structural and functional properties, as well as their interaction with the lipid
bilayer membrane, has been a field of intensive research in the last three decades [1].
Besides the span of generally hydrophobic residues in the TMH, there are other trends
in the sequence such as with a saddle-like distribution of polar residues (depressed
incidence of charged residues in the TMH itself), an enriched occurrence of positively
charged residues in the cytosolic flanking regions as well as an increased likelihood of
tryptophan and Tyrosine at either flank edge [6, 10, 13, 16, 84, 85]. Such properties
vary somewhat in length and intensity between various biological organelle membranes,

32

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

between prokaryotes and eukaryotes [86] and even among eukaryotic species studied
due to slightly different membrane constraints [7, 10]. These biological dispositions
are exploitable in terms of TM region prediction in query protein sequences [87, 88]
and tools such as the quite reliable TMHMM [40, 89], Phobius [42, 90] or DASTMfilter represent todays prediction limit of TMHs hydrophobic cores within the
protein sequence [91–93]. The prediction accuracy for true positives and negatives is
reported to be close to 100% and the remaining main cause of false positive prediction
are hydrophobic α–helices completely buried in the hydrophobic core of proteins. To
note, reliable prediction of TMHs and protein topology is a strong restriction for
protein function of even otherwise noncharacterised proteins [94–96] and thus, very
valuable information.
The “positiveinside rule” reported by von Heijne [8, 13] postulates the preferential
occurrence of positively charged residues (lysine and arginine) at the cytoplasmic edge
of TMHs. The practical value of positively charged residue sequence clustering in
topology prediction of TMH was first shown for the plasmalemma in bacteria [13,
97]. As a trend, the “positive-inside rule” has since been confirmed with statistical
observations for most membrane proteins and biological membrane types [6, 17, 98, 99].
However, more recent evidence suggests that, in thylakoid membranes, the “positiveinside rule” is less applicable due to the co-occurrence of aspartic acid and glutamic
acid residues together with positively charged residues [7].
The positive-inside rule also received support from protein engineering experiments
that revealed conclusive evidence for positive charges as a topological determinant [13,
80, 100, 101]. Mutational experiments demonstrated that charged residues, when
inserted into the centre of the helix, had a large effect on insertion capabilities of
the TMH via the translocon. Insertion becomes more unfavourable when the charge
was placed closer to the TMH core [15].
It remains unclear exactly why and how exactly the positive charge determines
topology from a biophysical perspective. Positively charged residues are suggested to
be stronger determinants of topology than negatively charged residues due to a dampening of the translocation potential of negatively charged residues. This dampening
factor is the result of protein-lipid interactions with net zero charged phospholipid,
phosphatidylethanolamine and other neutral lipids. This effect favours cytoplasmic

2.3. INTRODUCTION

33

retention of positively charged residues [102].
The recent accumulation of TMP sequences and structures allowed revisiting the
problem of charged residue distribution in TMHs (see also http://blanco.biomol.
uci.edu/mpstruc/). For example, whilst β–sheets contain charged residues in the TM
region, -helices generally do not (38). Large-scale sequence analysis of TMH from
various organelle membrane surfaces in eukaryotic proteomes confirm the clustering
of positive charge having a statistical bias for the cytosolic side of the membrane. At
the same time, there are many TMH exception examples to the positive-inside rule;
however as a trend, topology can be determined by simply looking for the most positive
loop region between helices [6, 10].
When the observation of positively charged residues preferentially localised at the
cytoplasmic edge of TMHs emerged, it was also asked whether negatively charged
residues work in concert with TMH orientation. It was shown that a single additional lysine residue can reverse the topology of a model Escherichia coli protein,
whereas a much higher number of negatively charged residues is needed to achieve the
same [80]; nevertheless, a sufficiently large negative charge can overturn the positiveinside rule [103, 104] and, thus indeed, negative residues are topologically active to a
point. Negatively charged residues were observed in the flanks of TMHs [6], especially
of marginally hydrophobic TM regions [105]. It is known that the negatively charged
acidic residues in TM regions have a non-trivial role in the biological context. In E.
coli, negative residues experience electrical pulling forces when travelling through the
SecYEG translocon indicating that negative charges are biologically relevant during
the electrostatic interactions of insertion [51, 106].
Unfortunately, there is a problem with statistical evidence for preferential negative charge occurrence next to TMH regions. Early investigations indicated overall
both positive and negative charge were influential topology factors, dubbed the charge
balance rule. If true, one would also expect to see a skew in the negative charge distribution if a cooperation between oppositely charged residues orientated a TMH [97,
107]. It might be expected that, if positive residues force the loop or tail to stay inside, negative residues would be drawn outside and topology would be determined not
unlike electrophoresis. Yet, there is plenty of individual protein examples but no conclusive statistical evidence in the current literature for a negatively charged skew [6,

34

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

7, 10, 14, 16, 17].
There are many observations described in the literature that charged residues determine topology more predictably in single-pass proteins than in multi-pass TMH [104,
108]. It is thought that the charges only determine the initial orientation of the TMH
in the biological membrane; yet, the ultimate orientation must be determined together
with the totality of subsequent downstream regions [109].
With sequence-based hydrophobicity and volume analysis and consensus sequence
studies, Sharpe et al. [10] demonstrated that there is asymmetry in the intramembranous space of some membranes. Crucially, this asymmetry differs among the membrane
of various organelles. They conclude that there are general differences between the
lipid composition and organisation in membranes of the Golgi and ER. Functional
aspects are also important. For example, the abundance of serines in the region following the lumenal end of Golgi TMHs appears to reflect the fact that this part of
many Golgi enzymes forms a flexible linker that tethers the catalytic domain to the
membrane [10].
A study by Baeza-Delgado et al. [6] analysed the distribution of amino acid
residue types in TMHs in 170 integral membrane proteins from a manually maintained database of experimentally confirmed TMPs (MPTopo [12]) as well as in 930
structures from the PDB. As expected, half of the natural amino acids are equally
distributed along TMH whereas aromatic, polar and charged amino acids along with
proline are biased near the flanks of the TM helices. Unsurprisingly, leucine and
other non-polar residues are far more abundant than the charged residues in the TM
region [10].
In this work, we revisit the issue of statistical evidence for the preferential distribution of negatively charged (and a few other) residues within and nearby TMHs. We
rely on the improved availability of comprehensive and large sequence and structure
datasets for TM proteins. We also show that several methodical aspects have hindered previous studies [6, 7, 10] to see the consistent non-trivial skew for negatively
charged residues disfavouring the cytosolic interfacial region and/or preferring the outside flank. First, we show that acidic residues are especially rare within and in the close
sequence environment of TMHs, even when compared to positively charged lysine and
arginine. Second, therefore, the manner of normalisation is critical: Taken together

2.3. INTRODUCTION

35

with the difficulty to properly align TMHs relative to their boundaries, column-wise
frequency calculations relative to all amino acid types as in previous studies will blur
possible preferential localisations of negative charges in the sequence. However, the
outcome changes when we ask where a negative charge occurs in the sequence relative to the total amount of negative charges in the respective sequence region. Thus,
by accounting for the rarity of acidic residues with sensitive normalisation, the “nonnegative inside rule/negative-outside rule” is clearly supported by the statistical data.
We find that minor changes in the flank definitions such as taking the TMH boundaries
from the database or by generating flanks by centrally aligning TMHs and applying
some standardised TMH length does not have a noticeable influence on the charge
bias detected.

Third, there are significant differences in the distribution of amino acid residues
between single-pass and multi-pass TM regions in both the intra-membrane helix and
the flanking regions with further variations introduced by taxa and by the organelles
along the secretory pathway. Importantly, we find that it is critical to weigh down the
effect of TMHs in multi-pass TMPs with no or super-short flanks to observe statistical
significance for the charge bias. To say it bluntly, if there are no flanks of sufficient
length, there is also no negative charge bias to be observed.

The charge bias effect is even clearer when a classification of TMHs into so-called
simple (which, as a trend, are mostly single-pass and mere anchors) and so-called complex (which typically have functions beyond anchorage) is considered [26, 53, 83]. We
also observe parallel skews with regard to leucine, tyrosine, tryptophan and cysteine
distributions. With these large-scale datasets and a sensitive normalisation approach,
new sequence features are revealed that provide spatial insight into TMH membrane
anchoring, recognition, helix-lipid, and helix-helix interactions.

Results
Acidic residues within and nearby TMH segments are
rare

In order to reliably compare the amino acid sequence properties of TMHs, we assembled datasets of TMH proteins from what are likely to be the best in terms of quality and comprehensiveness of annotation in eukaryotic and prokaryotic representative
genomes, as well as composite datasets to represent larger taxonomic groups and with
regard to sub-cellular locations (see Table 2.1). In total, 3292 single-pass TMH segments and 29898 multi-pass TMH segments were extracted from various UniProt [110]
text files according to TRANSMEM annotation (download dated 20–03–2016). The
UniProt datasets used only included manually curated records; however, it is still necessary to check for systematic bias due to the prediction methods used by UniProt
for TMH annotation in the majority of cases without direct experimental evidence.
Therefore, a fully experimentally verified dataset was also generated for comparison.
The representative 1544 single-pass and 15563 TMHs were extracted from the manually
curated experimentally verified TOPDB [111] database (download dated 21–03–2016)
referred to as ExpAll here (Table1). TMH organelle residency is defined according
to UniProt annotation. To ensure reliability, organelles were only analysed from a
representative redundancy-reduced protein dataset of the most well-studied genome:
Homo sapiens (referred to as UniHuman herein). The several datasets from UniProt
are subdivided into different human organelles (UniPM, UniER, UniGolgi) and taxonomical groups (UniHuman, UniCress, UniBacilli, UniEcoli, UniArch, UniFungi) as
described in Table 2.1 (see also Methods section). As will be shown below, these various datasets allow us to validate our findings for a variety of conditions, namely with
regard (i) to experimental verification of TMHs, (ii) to origin from various species and
taxonomic groups, (iii) to the number of TMHs in the same protein as well as (iv) to
sub-cellular localisation. Data-sets and programs used in this work can be downloaded
from http://mendel.bii.a-star.edu.sg/SEQUENCES/NNI/.
The hydrophobic nature of the lipid bilayer membrane implies that, generally,
charged residues should be rare within TMHs. For acidic residues, even the location
in the sequence vicinity of TMHs should be disfavoured because of the negatively

charged head groups of lipids directed towards the aqueous extracellular side or the
cytoplasm. In agreement with the biophysically justified expectations, the statistical
data confirms that acidic residues are especially rare in TMHs and their flanking
regions. In Figure 1 where we plot the total abundance of all amino acid types in
single-pass TMHs and multi-pass TMHs (including their ±5 flanking residues), acidic
residues were found to be amongst the rarest amino acids both in UniHuman and

acid types on the horizontal axis are listed in descending count. The bars were coloured according to
categorisations of hydrophobic, neutral and hydrophilic types according to the free energy of insertion
biological scale [15]. Grey represents hydrophilic amino acids that were found to have a positive ∆G
app, and blue represents hydrophobic residues with a negative ∆G app, purple denotes negative
residues and positive residues are coloured in orange. The abundances of key residues are labelled.

The effect is most pronounced in single-pass TMPs (Figure 2.1). There are only
666 glutamates (just 1.24% of all residues) and 560 aspartates (1.05% respectively)
among the total set of 53238 residues comprised in 1705 TMHs and their flanks.
Within just the TMH regions, there are 71 glutamates (0.20% of all residues in TMHs
and flanks) and 58 aspartates (0.16% respectively). This cannot be an artefact of
UniProt TMH assignments since this feature is repeated in ExpAll. There are only

2.4. RESULTS

39

582 glutamates (1.22%) and 520 aspartates (1.09%) among the 47568 residues involved. Within the TMH itself, there are 64 glutamates (0.19%) and 69 aspartates
(0.21%). In both cases, the negatively charged residues represent the ultimate end of
the distribution. To note, acidic residues are rare even compared to positively charged
residues which are about 3–4 times more frequent. On a much smaller dataset of
single-spanning TMP, Nakashima et al. [112] made similar compositional studies. To
compare, they found 0.94% glutamate and 0.94% aspartate within just the TMH region
(values very similar to ours from TMHs with small flanks; apparently, they used more
outwardly defined TMH boundaries) but the content of each glutamate and aspartate
within the extracellular or cytoplasmic domains is larger by an order of magnitude,
between 5.26% and 9.34%. These latter values tend to be even higher than the average
glutamate and aspartate composition throughout the protein database (5–6% [112]).

In the case of multi-pass TMPs (Figure 2.1), glutamates and aspartates are still
very rare in TMHs and their ±5 residue flanks (1.94% and 1.92% from the total of
377207 in the case of UniHuman respectively, 1.79% and 1.70% from the total of
454700 in the case of ExpAll). Yet, their occurrence is similar to those of histidine and
tryptophan and, notably, acidic residues are only about ∼1.5 times less frequent than
positively charged residues. The observation that acidic residues are more suppressed
in single-pass TMHs compared with the case of multi-pass TMHs is statistically significant. In Table 2.1, the acidic residues are counted in the helices (excluding flanking
regions) belonging to either multi-pass or single-pass helices. Indeed, single-pass helices appear to tolerate negative charge to a far lesser extent than multi-pass helices
as the data in the top two rows of Table 2.1 indicates (for datasets UniHuman and
ExpAll). The trend is strictly observed throughout sub-cellular localisations (rows 3–5
in Table 2.1) and taxa (rows 6–10). Statistical significance (P0.001) is found in all but
six cases. These are UniEcoli (D+E, D, E), UniArch (D+E, E) and UniFungi (E).
The problem is, most likely, that the respective datasets are quite small. Notably, the
difference between single- and multi-pass TMHs is greatest in UniPM; here, TMHs
from multi-pass proteins have on average 0.400 negative residues per helix, whereas
single-pass TMHs contained just 0.039 (P=3.86e-28).

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

2.4.2

Amino acid residue distribution analysis reveals a
“negative-not-inside/negative-outside” signal in singlepass TMH segments

The rarity of negatively charged residues is a complicating issue when studying their
distribution along the sequence positions of TMHs and their flanks. For UniHuman
and ExpAll , we plotted absolute abundance of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, lysine,
arginine, and leucine at each position (i.e., it scales as the equivalent fraction in the total composition of the alignment column) (Figure 2.2). To note, the known preference
of positively charged residues towards the cytoplasmic side is nevertheless evident. Yet,
it becomes apparent that any bias in the occurrence of the much rarer acidic residues
is overshadowed by fluctuations in the highly abundant residues such as leucine.
The trends become clearer if the occurrence of specific residues is normalised with
the total number of residues of the given amino acid type in the dataset observed in
the sequence region studied as shown for UniHuman and for ExpAll in Figure 2.2. For
comparison, we indicated background residue occurrences (dashed lines calculated as
averages for positions -25 to -30 and 25 to 30). The respective average occurrences in
the inside and outside flanks (calculated from an average of the values at positions -20
to -10 and 10 to 20 respectively) are shown with wide lines.
The “positive-inside rule” becomes even more evident in this normalisation:
Whereas the occurrence of positively charged residues is about the background level
at the outside flank, it is about two to three times higher both for the UniHuman and
the ExpAll datasets at the inside flank. To note, the background level was found to
be 1.7% (lysine) and 1.6% (arginine) in UniHuman and 1.4% (lysine and arginine) in
ExpAll. The inside flank average is 4.3% (lysine) and 4.6% (arginine) in UniHuman
and 4.2% (lysine) and 4.6% (arginine) in ExpAll. The outside flank is similar to the
background noise levels: about 1.4% (lysine) and 1.5% (arginine) in UniHuman and
about 1.5% (lysine) and 1.4% (arginine) in ExpAll.
Most interestingly, a “negativeinside depletion” trend for the negatively charged
residues is apparent from the distribution bias. The inside flank averages for glutamic
acid were 1.1% and 1.4% in UniHuman and ExpAll respectively; for aspartic acid,
1.2% and 1.4% in UniHuman and ExpAll respectively. Meanwhile, the outside flanks

single-pass proteins from (a) UniHuman and (b) ExpAll. Note that no clear trend can be seen in

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

for aspartic acid and glutamic acid occurrences were measured at 2.9% and 2.4%
respectively in UniHuman and, in ExpAll, these values for aspartic acid and glutamic
acid were found to be 2.5% and 2.1% respectively. Against the background level of
aspartic acid (2.8% and 2.9% in UniHuman) and glutamic acid (2.6% and 2.9% in
ExpAll), the inside flank averages were found to be about 2–3 times lower than the
background level while the outside flank averages were comparable to the background
level (Figure 2.2). Taken together, this indicates a clear suppression of negatively
charged residues at the inside flank of single-pass TMHs and a possible trend for
negatively charged residues occurring preferentially at the outside flank. This is not an
effect of the flank definition selection since the trend remains the same when using the
database-defined flanks without the context of the TMH (Figure 2.2). For UniHuman,
the negative charge expectancy on the inside flank doesnt reach above 2% until position
-10 (D) and position -11 (E), whereas, on the outside flank, both D and E start >2%.
The same can be seen in ExpAll where negative residues reach above 2% only as far
from the membrane boundary as at position -9 (D) and position -7 (E) on the inside
but exceed 2% beginning with position 1 (D) and 3 (E) on the outside (Figure 2.2).

The observation of negative charge suppression at the inside flank, herein the
“negative-inside depletion” rule, is statistically significant throughout most datasets
in this study. The inside-outside bias was counted using the Kruskal-Wallis (KW) test
comparing the occurrence of acidic residues within 10 residues of each TMH inside and
outside the TMH (Table 2.2). We studied both the database-reported flanks as well
as those obtained from central alignment of TMHs (see Methods). The null hypothesis (no difference between the two flanks) could be confidently rejected in all cases
(P-value<0.001 except for UniBacilli), the sign of the H-statistic (KW) indicating suppression at the inside and/or preference for the outside flank (except for UniArch).
Most importantly, acidic residues were found to be distributed with bias in ExpAll (Pvalue<3.47e-58) and in UniHuman (P-value=1.13e-93). Whereas with UniBacilli, the
problem is most likely the dataset size, the exception of UniArch, for which we observe
a strong negative inside rule, is more puzzling and indicates biophysical differences of
their plasma-membrane.

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

2.4.3

Amino acid residue distribution analysis reveals a general negative charge bias signal in outside flank of multipass TMH segments — the negative outside enrichment
rule

As a result of the rarity of negatively charged residues, any distribution bias is difficult to be recognised in the plot showing the total abundance (or alignment column
composition) of residues in multi-pass TMHs and their flanks from UniHuman and
ExpAll (Figure 2.3). Yet, as with single-pass helices, the dominant general leucine
enrichment, as well as positive inside signal, can be identified with certainty. When
the residue occurrence is normalised by the total occurrence of this residue type in the
sequence regions studied (shown as a relative percentage of at each position for multipass helices from UniHuman and ExpAll in Figure 2.3), the bias in the distribution of
any type of charged residues becomes visible.
With regard to the positive-inside preference, positively charged residues have a
background value of 2.0% for arginine and 2.2% for lysine in UniHuman, and 1.7%
for arginine and 1.9% for lysine in ExpAll. At the inside flank, this rises to 4.6% for
arginine and 4.1% for lysine in UniHuman and 4.6% for arginine and 4.2% for lysine
in ExpAll. The mean net charge at each position was calculated for multi-pass and
single-pass datasets from UniHuman and ExpAll (Figure 2.4). The positive inside rule
clearly becomes visible as the net charge has a positive skew approximately between
residues -10 and -25. What is noteworthy is that the peaks found for single-pass
helices were almost three times greater than those of multi-pass helices. For singlepass TMHs, the peak is +0.30 at position -15 in UniHuman and +0.31 at position
-14 in ExpAll, whereas TMHs from multi-pass proteins had lower peaks of +0.15
at position -13 in UniHuman and +0.10 at position -14 in ExpAll. Thus, there is a
positive charge bias towards the cytoplasmic side; yet, it is much weaker for multi-pass
than for single-pass TMHs.
Notably, a “negative outside enrichment” trend also can be seen from the distribution of the negatively charged residues, though with some effort (Table 3) as the effect
is also weaker than in the case of single-pass TMHs. We studied the flanks under four
conditions: (i) database-defined flanks without overlap between neighbouring TMHs,

Figure 2.4: The net charge across multi-pass and single-pass TMHs shows a stronger
positive inside charge in single-pass TMHs than multi-pass TMHs. The net charge per TMH
plotted at each position; the positive-inside rule is stronger in TMHs from single-pass proteins
than TMHs from multi-pass proteins. The net charge was calculated at each position as described
in the Methods section for the (A) UniHuman and (B) ExpAll datasets. Net charge for TMHs from
multi-pass proteins is shown in black, and the profile of TMHs from single-pass proteins is drawn in
blue.

flanks but allowing overlap of flanks shared among neighbouring TMHs, (iv) same as
condition (ii) but only the subset of cases where there is at least half of the required
flank length at either side of the TMH. In UniHuman as calculated under condition
(i), aspartic acid is lower on the inside flank (2.3%) than on the outside flank (3.0%).
Glutamic acid is also lower at the inside flank (2.4%) than the 2.8% on the outside
flank (Figure 2.3C). Slight variations in defining the membrane boundary point do
not influence the trend (compare figures 2.3C and 2.3E). We find that, in all studied conditions, the UniHuman dataset delivers statistical significances (P-values: (i)
6.10e-34, (ii) 5.43e-41, (iii) 3.00e-57, (iv) 5.60e-41) strongly supporting negative charge
bias (inside suppression/outside preference; see Table 2.3).
Surprisingly, the result could not straightforwardly be repeated with the considerably smaller ExpAll. Under condition (i), we find with ExpAll that aspartic acid has
a background level of 1.0%, an average of 2.6% on the inside flank, and of 2.9% on the
outside flank but glutamic acids background is 1.2% but 2.8% on the inside flank and
2.5% on the outside flank. Statistical tests do not support finding a negative charge
bias in conditions (i) and (ii). Apparently, the problem is TMHs having no or almost
no flanks at one of the sides. Statistical significance for the negative charge bias is
detected as soon as this problem is dealt with either by allowing extension of flanks
overlap among neighbouring TMHs as in condition (iii) or by kicking out examples
without proper flank lengths from the dataset as in condition (iv). The respective
P-values are 2.05e-6 and 9.81e-15 respectively.

Table 2.3: Statistical significances for negative charge distribution skew on either side
of the membrane in multi-pass TMHs The “Helices” column refers to the total TMHs contained
in each dataset (ExpALL, TMH from TOPDB [111]; UniHuman, human representative proteome;
UniER, human endoplasmic reticulum representative proteome; UniGolgi, human Golgi representative proteome; UniPM, human plasma membrane representative proteome; UniCress, Arabidopsis thaliana (mouse-ear cress) representative proteome, UniFungi, fungal representative proteome;
UniBacilli, Bacilli class representative proteome; UniEcoli, Escherichia coli representative proteome;
UniArch, Archaea representative proteome; see Methods for details). In (A) the “Database-defined
flanks” and in (B) the “Database-defined viable* flanks” and the “Overlapping flanks” columns, the
“Negative residues” column refers to the total number of negative residues found in the ±10 flanking
residues on either side of the TMH and does not include residues found in the TMH itself. (A) In the
“Flanks after central alignment” column, the “Negative residues” column refers to the total number
of negative residues found in the 20 to 10 residues and the +10 to +20 residues from the centrally
aligned residues with a maximum database defined flank length of 20 residues. The total number of
proteins is given in the IDs column. The “Helices” column contains the total number of TMHs in
the dataset (n), the average number of TMHs per protein in that population (µ) and the standard
deviation of that average (σ). The KW scores were calculated for negative residues by comparing
the number of negatively charged residues that were within 10 residues inside and 10 residues outside
the TMH.
*Here, “viable” indicates that in each TMH used for both flanks either side of the TMH has a flank
length of at least half the maximum allowed flank length, in this case 10 (the viable length is 5)

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE
The issues we had with ExpAll raised the question that, maybe, sequence redun-

dancy in the UniHuman set could have played a role. Therefore, we repeated all
calculations but with UniRef50 instead of UniRef90 for mapping into sequence clusters (see Methods section for detail). We were surprised to see that harsher sequence
redundancy requirements do not affect the outcome of the statistical tests in any major way. For the conditions (i)- (iv), we computed the following P-values: (i) 1.31e-28
(5940 negatively residues inside versus 7492 outside), (ii) 1.38e-36 (5516 versus 7320),
(iii) 5.60e-53 (7089 versus 9233) and (iv) 4.18e-41 (4232 versus 5730).
So, the amplifying effect of some subsets in the overall dataset on the statistical
test that might be caused by allowing overlapping flanks (condition (iii)) is not the
major factor leading to the negative charge skew. Similarly, the trend is also not
caused by sequence redundancy. Thus, we have learned that the negative charge bias
does also exist in multi-pass TMPs but under the conditions that there are sufficiently
long loops between TMHs. Bluntly said: no loops equals to no charge bias. As
soon as the loops reach some critical length, there are differences between single-pass
and multi-pass TMHs with regard to occurrence and distribution of negative charges
and the inside-suppression/outside-enrichment negative charge bias appears. Not only
are there more negative charges within the multi-pass TMH itself (in fact, negative
charges are almost not tolerated in single-pass TMHs; see Table 2.1), but also, there is
a much stronger negative outside skew in the TMHs of single-pass proteins than those
of multi-pass proteins.

2.4.4

Further significant sequence differences between singlepass and multi-pass helices: distribution of tryptophan,
tyrosine, proline and cysteine

Amino acid residue profiles along the TM segment and its flanks differ between singleand multi-pass TMHs also in other aspects. The relative percentages of all amino
acid types (normalisation by the total amount of that residue type in the sequence
segment) from single-pass helices of the UniHuman (Figure 2.5A; from 1705 TMHs
with flanks having 68571 residues) and ExpAll (Figure 2.5B; from 1544 TMHs with
flanks having 60200 residues) were plotted as a heat-map. The amino acid types were

listed on the Y axis according to Kyte & Doolittle hydrophobicity [30] in descending
order.

In accordance with expectations, enrichment for hydrophobic residues in the TMH,
for the positively charged residues on the inside flank as well as a distribution the negative distribution bias was found in both datasets. Additionally, the inside interfacial
region showed consistent enrichment hotspots for tryptophan (e.g., 7.1% at position
-11 in ExpAll, 6.2% at position -10 in UniHuman with flanks after central TMH alignment) and tyrosine (6.4% at -11 in ExpAll, 7.1% at -11 in UniHuman), and some
preference can also be seen for the outer interfacial region (e.g., 5.2% at position 11
for tryptophan in ExpAll, and 5.8% at position 10 for tryptophan in UniHuman) albeit the “hot” cluster of the outer flank covers fewer positions than that of the inner
flank. Further, there is an apparent bias of cysteine on the inner flank and interfacial
region (e.g., 5.5% at position -10 in ExpAll, 5.9% at position -11 in UniHuman), and
a depression in the outer interfacial region and flank (up to a minimum of 0.3% in
both ExpAll and UniHuman). Proline appears to have a depression signal on the outer
flank. Note that, in a similar way to Figures 2.2 and 2.3, the distributions of the flanks
derived from centrally aligned TMHs are corroborated by the distributions from the
database defined TMH boundary flanks (see outside bands in Figures 2.5A-D).

A similar heatmap was generated for UniHuman multi-pass (Figure 2.5C; from
12353 TMHs with flanks having 452708 residues) TMHs and ExpAll multi-pass (Figure
2.5D; from 15563 TMHs with flanks having 535599 residues). Whereas Figures 2.5A-C
appear quite noisy, the plot for ExpAll multi-pass TMHs appears almost Gaussian-like
smoothed, thus, indicating the quality of this dataset. Tyrosine and tryptophan in the
multi-pass case do not appear as enriched in the interfacial regions of single-pass TMHs
from both UniHuman and ExpAll. Prolines are only suppressed in the TMH itself and
are not suppressed in the outer flank as in the single-pass case but, indeed, are tolerated
if not slightly enriched in the flanks.

Figure 2.5: Relative percentage heat-maps from predictive and experimental datasets
corroborate residue distribution differences between TMHs from single-pass and multipass proteins. The residue position aligned to the centre of the TMH is on the horizontal axis,
and the residue type is on the vertical axis. Amino acid types are listed in order of decreasing hydrophobicity according to the Kyte and Doolittle scale [52]. The flank lengths in the TMH segments
were restricted to up to ±10 residues. The scales for each heat-map are shown beneath the respective
subfigure. The darkest blue represents 0% distribution, whilst the darkest red represents the maximum relative percentage distribution that is denoted by the keys in each subfigure, with white being
50% between “cold” and “hot”. The central TMH subplots extend from the central TMH residue,
whereas the inner and outer flank subplots use the database-defined TMH boundary and extend from
that position. a TMHs from the single-pass UniHuman dataset. b Single-pass protein TMHs from
the ExpAll dataset. c TMHs from the proteins of the multi-pass UniHuman dataset. d TMHs from
ExpAll multi-pass proteins. The general consistency in relative distributions of every residue type
between single-pass and multi-pass of either dataset including flank/TMH boundary selection allows
us to infer biological conclusions from these distributions that are independent of methodological biases used to gather the sequences. The only residue that displays drastically differently between the
datasets is cysteine in multi-pass TMHs only. The most striking differences in distributions between
residues from TMHs of single-pass and multi-pass proteins include a more defined Y and W clustering
at the flanks, a suppression of E and D on the inside flank, a suppression of P on the inside flank and
a topological bias for C favouring the inside flank.

Hydrophobicity and leucine distribution in TMHs in
single- and multi-pass proteins

Generally, we see in Figure 2.5 that compositional biases appear more extreme in
the single-pass case, particularly when it comes to polar and non-polar residues being
more heavily suppressed and enriched. To investigate this observation, we calculated
the hydrophobicity at each sequence-position averaged over all TMHs considered (after
having window-averaged over 3 residues for each TMH) using the Kyte & Doolittle hydrophobicity scale [30] (Figure 2.6A) and validated using White and Wimley octanolinterface whole residue scale [32], Hessas biological hydrophobicity scale [15], and the
Eisenberg hydrophobic moment consensus scale [39] (Supplementary Figure 2.7). The
total set of TMHs was split into 15 sets of membrane-spanning proteins (1 set containing single-pass proteins, 13 sets each containing TMHs from 2-, 3-, 4-. . . 14-TMPs and
another of TMHs from proteins with 15 or more TMHs). In Figure 2.6B, we show the
P-value at each sequence position by comparing the respective values from multi-pass
and single-pass TMHs using the 2-sample t-test (Figure 2.6B). Strikingly, the inside
flank of the single-pass TMHs is much more hydrophilic (e.g., see the Kyte & Doolittle score=-1.3 at position -18) than that of multi-pass TMHs (P-value=5.64e-103 at
position -14). Most likely, the positive inside rule, along with the interfacial clustering
of tryptophan and tyrosine, contribute to a strong polar inside flank in single-pass
helices that is not present in multi-pass helices en masse. Further, multi-pass TMHs
cluster remarkably closely within the TM core; the respective hydrophobicity is apparently not dependent on the number of TMHs in a given multi-pass TMP. On
average, single-pass TMHs are more hydrophobic in the core than multi-pass TMHs
(P-value<1.e-72 within positions -55 and P-value=5.92e-190 at position 0). On the
other hand, hydrophobicity differences between TMHs from single- and multi-pass proteins fade somewhat at the transition towards the flanks (P-value=1.85e-4 at position
-10, and P-value=3.35e-31 at position 10).
Leucine is the most abundant residue in TMHs (Figure 2.1) and is considered one
of the most hydrophobic residues by all hydrophobicity scales. Therefore, it plays a
very influential role in TMH helix-helix and lipid-helix interactions in the membrane
and recognition by the insertion machinery. When looking at the difference in the

Figure 2.6: There is a difference in the hydrophobic profiles of TMHs from single-pass
and multi-pass proteins. a The hydrophobicity of single-pass TMHs compared to multi-pass
segments from the UniHuman dataset. The Kyte and Doolittle scale of hydrophobicity [30] was
used with a window length of 3 to compare TMHs from proteins with different numbers of TMHs.
This scale is based on the water-vapour transfer of free energy and the interior-exterior distribution
of individual amino acids. The same datasets also had different scales applied (Figure 2.7). The
vertical axis is the hydrophobicity score, whilst the horizontal axis is the position of the residue
relative to the centre of the TMH, with negative values extending into the cytoplasm. In black are
the average hydrophobicity values of TMHs belonging to single-pass TMHs, whilst in other colours
are the average hydrophobicity values of TMHs belonging to multi-pass proteins containing the same
numbers of TMHs per protein. In purple are the TMHs from proteins with more than 15 TMHs per
protein that do not share a typical multi-pass profile, perhaps due to their exceptional nature. b The
Kruskal-Wallis test (H statistic) was used to compare single-pass windowed hydrophobicity values
with the average windowed hydrophobicity value of every TMH from multi-pass proteins at the same
position. The vertical axis is the logarithmic scale of the resultant P values. We can much more
readily reject the hypothesis that hydrophobicity is the same between TMHs from single-pass and
multi-pass proteins in the core of the helix and the flanks than the interfacial regions, particularly at
the inner leaflet due to leucine asymmetry ( Table 2.4)

Figure 2.7: There is a difference in the hydrophobic profiles of TMHs from single-pass
and multi-pass proteins. The difference in hydrophobicity between the single-pass and multipass datasets stratified by number of TMHs is not due to the choice of scale. As with Figure 2.6,
UniHuman was stratified according to the number of TMHs in each protein. The mean amino acid
hydrophobicity values of TMHs with a sliding unweighted window of 3 residues from UniHuman
proteins at each position were plotted. To validate the findings presented in Figure 2.6A, several
scales of hydrophobicity were used. (A) The White and Wimley whole residue scale [32] is based on
the partitioning of peptides between water and octanol as well as water to POPC. A positive score
indicates a more polar score. (B) The Hessa biological scale [15]. The hydrophobicity values represent
the free energy exchange during recognition of designed peptide TMHs by the endoplasmic reticulum
Sec61 translocon and, therefore, negative values indicate an energetic preference for the interior of a
lipid bilayer. (C) The Eisenberg consensus scale [39] is a scale based on the earlier scales from Nozaki
and Tanford [33], Wolfenden et al. [37], Chothia [35], Janin [36] and the von Heijne and Blomberg
scale [38]. The scales are normalised according to serine. A positive score indicates a generally more
hydrophobic score.

single-pass proteins have a trend to contain more leucine residues at the cytoplasmic side of TMHs, particularly in the case of TMHs from single-pass proteins (see
Figures 2.2 and 2.5).
This trend is statistically significant for TMHs in many biological membranes (Table 2.4, Figure 2.8). In the most extreme case of UniCress (single-pass), we see 49%
more leucine residues on the inside leaflet than the outside leaflet (P-value=5.41e-24).
This contrasts with UniCress (multi-pass), in which the skew is far weaker, albeit yet
statistically significant. There are 6% more leucine residues at the inside half (Pvalue=2.08e-4). The trend of having more leucine residues at the cytoplasmic half of
the TMH is observed for all datasets (both single- and multi-pass) except for UniArch
(single-pass). The phenomenon is statistically significant with P-value<1.e-3 for ExpAll, UniHuman, UniPM and UniCress (both single- and multi-pass). As with negative
charge distribution, UniArch presents a reversed effect compared to other single-pass
protein datasets with a 57% reduction in leucine on the inside leaflet compared to the
outside leaflet (P-value=7.25e-6). However, leucine of TMHs from UniArch multi-pass
proteins have no discernible preference for the inside leaflets (4% more on the inside
leaflet, P-value=0.625).

statistical results when comparing the number of leucine residues from the inner and outer leaflets

Figure 2.8: Comparing charged amino acid distributions in TMHs of multi-pass and
single-pass proteins across different species and organelles. The relative percentage distribution of charged residues and leucine was calculated at each position in the TMH with flank lengths
of ±20 in different datasets. The distributions are normalised according to relative percentage distribution. Aspartic acid and glutamic acid are shown in dark purple and light purple respectively.
Leucine, the most abundant non-polar residue in TMHs, is in blue. Arginine and lysine are shown
in orange. TMHs from single-pass proteins are on the left and TMHs from multi-pass proteins are
on the right for different taxonomic datasets: a UniCress, b UniFungi, c UniEcoli, d UniBacilli, e
UniArch, and different organelles: f UniER, g UniGolgi, h UniPM. As a trend, the negative-outside
skew is more present in TMHs from single-pass proteins than multi-pass proteins (Tables 2 and 3).
Another key observation is that in single-pass TMHs there is a propensity for leucine on the inner
over the outer leaflet (Table 2.4)

A negative-outside (or negative-non-inside) signal is
present across many membrane types

regard to membranes at various subcellular localisations. Acidic residues for TMHs
from single-pass and multi-pass helices were plotted according to their relative percentage distributions (of the total amount of this residue type in the respective segment) for
five taxon-specific datasets UniCress (Figure 2.8A), UniFungi (Figure 2.8B), UniEcoli
(Figure 2.8C), UniBacilli (Figure 2.8D), UniArch (Figure 2.8E) and for three organellespecific datasets UniER (Figure 2.8F), UniGolgi (Figure 2.8G), UniPM (Figure 2.8H).
For single-pass proteins in all taxon-specific datasets (with the exception of
UniArch), there are more negative residues at the outside than at the inside. The
skew is statistically significant (see Table 2.2, P<0.001) except for UniBacilli. Despite
statistical significance found for UniFungi (P-value=1.12e-7 for database-defined and
P-value=6.79e-10 for flanks after central alignment; Table 2.2), however, the trend is
not very strong in this case (Figure 2.8B). Whereas the skew is just a suppression of
negatively charged residues at the inside flank for ExpAll and UniHuman (as well as
in UniCress), the bias observed for UniEcoli involves also a negative charge enrichment at the outside flank. In the case of UniArch (Figure 2.8E), we see a negative
inside preference that is 6.0% in the case of aspartic acid, and 6.3% for glutamic acid
(not shown), with much lower values close to 0% on the outside. Whilst the difference is statistically significant for both TMHs (Table 2.2) from single-pass proteins
(P-value=1.83e-12 and P-value=1.43e-11 for two versions of flank determination) and
multi-pass proteins (P-values 4.72e-3, 7.81e-3, 1.28e-4 for three versions of flank determination, see Tables 3A and 3B), the distribution along the position axis is heavily
fluctuating, maybe as a result of the small size of the dataset. However, one can assuredly assign a “negative-inside” tendency to the flanking regions of Archaean TMHs.
In the human organelle datasets, we see trend shifts at different stages in the
secretory pathway. In UniER, there is an enrichment of negative charge on the outside
flank of 1–1.5% that is comparable to the magnitude of the positive inside signal. In
UniGolgi, there is a suppression of negatively charged residues on the inside flank as
well as an enrichment on the inside flank resulting in ∼2% distribution difference. For
UniPM, there is a negative-inside suppression (but no outside enrichment) as well as
a positive-inside signal. All observed trends are statistically significant (see Table 2.2,
P<1.e-5).
For multi-pass TMH proteins, we see either the same trends but in a weaker form

56

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

or no skews are observed at all as inspection of the graphs in Figure 2.8 shows. For
datasets UniER, UniGolgi, UniCress, UniFungi, and UniBacilli, the hypothesis of equal
distribution of negatively charged residues cannot be rejected (P-value>0.001, see Table 3); thus, a skew is statistically non-significant. Although UniPM has a statistically
significant bias (P-value<4.30e-12, Table 3), the trends are more subtle and most
present for aspartic acid of UniPM. We see many more negative and positive charges
tolerated within the multi-pass TMHs themselves throughout all datasets (Table 2.1).
To note, there is a positive-inside rule for all multi-pass datasets studied herein.
To conclude, we find that negative-charge bias distribution is a feature of singlepass protein TMHs that is present across many membrane types and it can have the
form of a negative charge suppression at the inside flank or an enrichment of those
charges at the outside flank.

2.4.7

Amino acid compositional skews in relation to TMH
complexity and anchorage function

In previous work, we studied the relationship of TMH composition, sequence complexity and function [26, 53, 83] and concluded that simple TMHs are more probably
responsible for simple membrane anchorage, whereas complex TMHs have a biological
function beyond just anchorage. We wished to see how the skews observed in this
work relate to that classification. Therefore, the single-pass TMHs from UniHuman
and ExpAll were separated into subsets of simple, twilight, and complex TMHs using
TMSOC [26, 83]. The relative percentages of eight residue types (L, D, E, R, K, Y,
W, C; normalisation with the total amount of residues of that amino acid type in
all sequence segments considered) were plotted along the sequence position for simple
and complex helices (Figure 2.9). Of UniHuman single-pass proteins, there were 889
records with simple TMHs and 570 with complex TMHs (Figure 2.9B). In ExpAll,
769 TMHs from single-pass proteins were simple TMHs and 570 were complex TMHs.
It is visually apparent (Figure 2.9) that there are (i) stronger skews and more
inside-outside disparities in simple single-pass TMs than in complex single-pass TMs
and (ii) greater similarities between single-pass complex TM regions and those from
multi-pass proteins compared with simple single-pass TMs in comparison with either

Figure 2.9: Comparing the amino acid relative percentage distributions of simple and
complex TMHs from single-pass proteins and TMHs from multi-pass proteins. Comparing the amino acid relative percentage distributions of simple and complex TMHs from single-pass
proteins and TMHs from multi-pass proteins. TMSOC was used to calculate which single-pass TMHs
were complex and which were simple from ExpAll and UniHuman datasets. Simple TMHs are typically anchors without necessarily having other functions (Wong et al. [53]). The relative percentages
from single-pass simple (shown in light blue), single-pass complex (red), and multi-pass protein TMHs
(black) were plotted for (a, c, e, g, i and k) UniHuman and (b, d, f, h, j and l) ExpAll for (a and
b) positive residues, (c and d) negative residues, (e and f) tyrosine, (g and h) tryptophan, (i and j)
leucine and (k and l) cysteine. The slopes are statistically compared in Tables 5 and 6, and as a
trend, the profiles of complex TMHs are more similar to multi-pass TMH profiles than simple TMHs
are to multi-pass TMHs

58

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

of the other two distributions. To examine the statistical significance of these observations, we compared the amino acid distributions (K, R, K+R, D, E, D+E, Y, W, L,
C) across the range of TMHs with flank lengths ±10 residues using the KolmogorovSmirnov (KS), KW and the χ2 statistical tests. To note, the KS test scrutinises for
significant maximal absolute differences between distribution curves; the glskw test is
after skews between distributions and the χ2 statistical test checks the average difference between distributions. Calculations were carried out over single-pass complex,
single-pass simple and multi-pass TMH datasets from both ExpAll and UniHuman (for
P-values and Bahadur slopes, Table 2.5 (dataset UniHuman) and Table 2.6 (dataset
ExpAll)).
Many low P-values in Tables 2.5 and 2.6 indicate significant differences between
the three distributions studied. For the UniHuman dataset (Table 2.5), we find most
striking, significant differences between charged residue distributions (R, K, D, E) of
simple and complex single-pass TMH+flank regions (χ2 P-value<2.23e-3 for single
amino acid types). Similarly, simple single-pass TMH+flank segments differ significantly from multi-pass TMH+flank segments (KW test P-values<3.e-2 for R, K, D,
E, Y, W amino acid types as well as for K+R and D+E). The trends are the same for
the ExpAll dataset (Table 2.6): simple and complex single-pass TMH+flank regions
differ in charged amino acid type distributions (χ2 P-value<4.21e-3 for all cases), as
well as simple single-pass and multi-pass ones, do (KW test P-values<5.e-2 for R, D,
E, Y, W amino acid types and D+E).
Whereas P-value tests for significant differences between distributions depend
strongly on the amount of data, the more informative Bahadur slopes that measure
the distance from the zero hypothesis are independent of the amount of data [113–
115]. As we can see in Tables 2.5 and 2.6, the absolute Bahadur slopes for the simple single-pass to multi-pass comparison are always larger (even by at least an order
of magnitude): (ii) for all three statistical tests applied (χ2 , KS and KW), (ii) for
all amino acid types, for K+R and E+D and (iii) for both datasets UniHuman and
ExpAll. Thus, complex single-pass TMH+flanks have compositional properties that
are indeed very similar to those of multi-pass ones (which are known to have a large
fraction of complex TMHs [26, 83]). This strong evidence implies that the actual issue is not so much about single- and multi-pass TMH segments but between simple

and complex TMHs where the first are exclusively guided by the anchor requirements
whereas the latter have more complex restraints to fulfil.
Several distribution features of simple TMHs from single-pass proteins when compared to complex TMHs from single-pass proteins and TMHs from multi-pass proteins
that contribute to the statistical differences (Figure 2.9) are especially notable. There
is a more pronounced trend for positively charged residues and tyrosine to be preferentially located on the inside flanks and for negatively charged residues to be on
the outside flanks. The symmetrical peaks in the percentage distribution of tyrosine
in complex single-pass TMHs are more akin to multi-pass TMHs, whereas in simple TMHs the distribution resembles a more typical single-pass helix (compare with
Figure 2.2). Furthermore, the depression of charged residues within the TMH itself is
strongest in simple single-pass TMHs.
To emphasise, tryptophan is essentially not tolerated within the simple TMHs and
there are higher peaks of tryptophan occurrence at either flank. We also see a strong
inside skew for leucine clustering within the core of simple TMHs which is not present
in the “flatter” distributions of complex single-pass TMHs and TMHs from multi-pass
proteins.
There is obviously a cysteine-inside preference for simple, single-pass TMHs but
less in complex, multi-pass TMHs (Figure 2.9). This conclusion is contrary to a
previous study [112] but that deduction was drawn from a much smaller dataset of 45
single-pass TMHs and 24 multi-pass TMPs.

2.5

Discussion

The “negative-outside/non-negative inside” skew in TMHs and their flanks is statistically significant We have seen that, consistently throughout the datasets, there is
a trend for generally rare negatively charged residues to prefer the outside flank of
a TMH rather than the inside (and to almost completely avoid the TMH itself); be
it by suppression on the inside and/or enrichment on the outside. The trend is much
stronger in single-pass protein datasets than in multi-pass protein datasets. However
as we elaborated on further, the real crux of the bias appears to be associated with
the TMH being simple or complex [26, 83], thus, whether or not the TMH has a role

62

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

beyond anchorage. The existence of this bias has implications for topology prediction
of proteins with TMHs, engineering membrane proteins as well as for models of protein
transport via membranes and protein-membrane stability considerations.
It should be noted that the controversy in the scientific community about the existence of a negative charge bias at TMHs was mainly with regard to multi-pass TMPs.
Despite having access to much larger, better annotated sequence datasets and many
more 3D structures than our predecessors, we also had our share of difficulties here (see
Results section III and Table 3). The straightforward approach results in inconclusive
statistical tests if datasets become small (for example, if selections are restricted to subcellular localisations, 3D structures or if very harsh sequence redundancy criteria are
applied) and, especially, if TMHs with very short or no flanks are included. Therefore
in the case of multi-pass proteins, we studied flanks as taken from the TM boundaries
in the databases under several conditions: (i) without allowing flank overlap between
neighbouring TMHs, (ii) as subset of (i) but with requiring some minimal flank length
at either side, (iii) with overlapping flanks. We also studied flanks after central alignment of TMHs and assuming standardised TMH length. Multi-pass TMHs (without
overlapping flanks) do not show statistically significant negative charge bias under
condition (i) but, apparently, due to many TMHs without any or super-short flanks
at least at one side. Significance appears as soon as subsets of TMHs with flanks at
both sides are studied. Not surprisingly, there is no charge bias if there are no flanks
in the first place. It is perhaps worth noting that the results from multi-pass TMHs
with overlapping flanks may involve amplification of skews since it involves multiple
counting of the same residues. Given the redundancy threshold of UniRef90, we cannot rule out that these statistical skews are the result of a trend from only a small
sub-group of TMPs which is being amplified. Hence, we also needed to observe if these
same observed biases were true in condition (ii), which is indeed the case.
As the “negative-outside/negative-not-inside” skew is widely observed among varying taxa and subcellular localisations with statistical significance, it appears to, at
least to a certain extent, be caused by physical reasons and be associated with
the background membrane potential.

Several earlier considerations and observa-

tion support this thought: (i) Firstly, a concert between the negative and positive

2.5. DISCUSSION

63

charge on the TMH flanks drives anchorage and the direction of insertion of engineered TMHs [97, 107]. (ii) The inner leaflet of the plasmalemma tends to be more
negatively charged [116]. Specifically, phosphatidylserine was found to distribute in
the cytosolic leaflets of the plasma membrane and it was found to electrostatically interact with moderately positive-charged proteins enough to redirect the proteins into
the endocytic pathway [117]. The negative charge of proteins at the inside of the
plasma-membrane would decrease the anchoring potency of the TMH via electrostatic
repulsion. (iii) Thirdly in membranes that maintain a membrane potential, there are
inevitably electrical forces acting on charged residues during chain translocation as
this influences the translocon machinery when orienting the TMH. Therefore, it is no
surprise that we see an inside-outside bias for negatively charged residues that is opposite to the one for positively charged residues. The negative charges in TMH residues
have been shown to experience an electrical pulling force as they pass through the
bacterial SecYEG translocon import [51, 106]. Also, they are known to be involved in
intra-membrane helix-helix interactions [118]. For example, aspartic acid and glutamic
acid can drive efficient di- or trimerisation of TMHs in lipid bilayers and, furthermore,
that aspartic acid interactions with neighbouring TMHs can directly increase insertion
efficiency of marginally hydrophobic TMHs via the Sec61 translocon [118]. In support
of this, less acidic residues are found in single-pass TMHs, among which only some
will undergo intra-membrane helix-helix interactions. As the mutation studies have
shown negative charge as a topological determinant [80], therefore, it is perhaps no
surprise that we observe a skew in negatively charged residues in a similar manner to
the skew in positively charged residues.

Whereas the “negative-outside/negative-not-inside” skew is observed for distantly
related eukaryotic species and it is also present in Gram-negative bacteria such as
E. coli, this sequence pattern was not observed for the Gram-positive bacteria in
which there is no observable bias. In contrast, Archaea have a statistically significant
“negative-inside” propensity both for single- and multi-pass TMPs. It is known that
Archaea have remarkably different membranes compared to other kingdoms of life due
to their extremophile adaptations to stress [119]. Whilst it is unclear why negative
charge is distributed so differently in UniArch to the other taxonomic datasets, one

64

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

must appreciate that a much more nuanced approach would be needed to draw formal conclusions about Archaea, which current databases cannot provide due to the
relatively limited information and annotation of Archaean proteomes.
Methodological issues made previous studies struggle to identify negatively charged
skews with statistical significance
Whereas the influence of a negative charge bias in engineered proteins with TM
regions on the direction of insertion into the membrane was solidly established [14, 80,
103, 104, 120], the search for the negative charge distribution pattern in the statistics
of sequences of TM proteins from databases failed to find significance for the expected
negative charge skew [6, 7, 10, 14, 16, 17].
Generally speaking, the datasets from previous studies have been considerably
smaller compared with those in our work (only Sharpe et al. had a similar order of
magnitude [10]), especially those with experimental information about 3D structure
and membrane topology that we used for validation. And they might not have had
the luxury of using UniProts improved TRANSMEM consensus annotation based on
a multitude of TM prediction methods and experimental data, but this is also not
the major issue. We found that there are other factors that are critical for observing
sequence bias such as negative charge skew in the case of TMHs.
i Acidic residues are rare near and within TMH and biases in their distribution
are easily blurred by minor fluctuations of much more frequent amino acid types,
most notably leucine. Therefore, the method of normalisation is critical. We have
shown that normalising by the total amount of residues of the amino acid type
studied within the sequence region under consideration is appropriate to answer
the question where to find a negatively charged residue if there is any at all (called
“relative percentage” in this work).
ii The alignment of the TMHs is critical. It was common practice to align TMH
according to the most cytosolic residue [10] although it is known that the membrane/cytosol boundary of the TMH is not well defined (and the exact boundary is
even less well understood at the non-cytosolic side). Aligning the TM regions and
their flanks from the center of the TMH was first proposed by Baeza-Delgado et
al. [6]. Since we know now that acidic residues are often suppressed in the cytosolic

2.5. DISCUSSION

65

flank and within the TMH, this implies that the few acidic residues found in the
cytosolic interface would appear more comparable to those in the poorly defined
non-cytosolic interface as the respective residues are spread over more potential
positions, diminishing any observable bias.
iii We find that separation into single- and multi-pass TM datasets (or, even better,
simple and complex TMHs [26, 83]) is critical to study the inside/outside bias. As
many TMHs in multi-pass TMPs have essentially no flanks or very short flanks if
the condition of non-overlap is applied to flanks of neighbouring TMHs, this might
also obscure the observation of the negative charge bias. If there are no flanks,
then there will be no residue distribution bias in these flanks. The problem can be
alleviated by either studying only subsets with minimal flank lengths on both sides
(although datasets might become too small for statistical analysis) or by allowing
flank overlaps between neighbouring TMHs.
iv This classification is even more justified in the light of previous reports about the
“missing hydrophobicity” in multi-pass TMHs [31, 80, 121, 122]. Otherwise, the
distribution bias well observed among the exclusive anchors could be lost to noise.
This addresses the more biologically contextualised issue that there are different
evolutionary pressures on different types of TMHs. The negative charge skew is
most pronounced for dedicated anchors frequently found with simple TMHs typically observed in single-pass TM proteins. These TMHs are pressured to exhibit
residue biases that may aid anchorage in a topologically correct manner. Complex TMHs, typically within multi-pass membrane proteins that have a function
beyond anchorage, comply with a multitude of restraints structural and functional
constraints and the negative charge skew is just one of them.
The most representative precedent papers are those of Sharpe et al. [10] from 2010
(with 1192 human and 1119 yeast single-pass TMHs), Baeza-Delgado et al. [6] (with
792 TMHs mixed from single- and multi-pass TMPs) and Pogozheva et al. [7] (TMHs
from 191 mixed from single- and multi-pass TMPs with structural information) both
from 2013. Whereas the first analysis would have benefited from the central alignment
approach and the first two studies from another normalisation as described above,
the third study did come close to our findings. To note, their dataset mixed with

66

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

single- and multi-pass proteins was too small for revealing the negative charge bias
with significance; yet, they observed total charge differences at either sides of the
membrane varying for both single- and multi-pass proteins. Membrane asymmetry
due to positively charged residues occurring more frequently on the cytosolic side
causes net charge unevenness at both sides of the membrane. This observation has
been known to correlate with orientation for decades [6, 13, 118]. Our data shows that
the negative charge skew contributes to this asymmetry.
There are differences in charged amino acid residue biases in TMH flanks through
each stage of the secretory pathway
Here, we observe differences throughout sub-cellular locations along the secretory
pathway. We found that negative charges are enriched at the outside flank (in the ER),
both enriched outside and suppressed inside for the Golgi membrane, and suppressed
on the inside flank in the Plasma Membrane (PM). It has been suggested that the
leaflets of different membranes have different lipid compositions throughout the secretory pathway [9] and this has led to general biochemical conservation in terms of TMH
length and amino acid composition in different membranes [7, 10].
Lipid asymmetry in the Golgi and PM (in contrast to the ER) has been known
about for over a decade [123, 124]. To note, the Golgi and PM have lipid asymmetry with sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids on the non-cytosolic leaflet, and
phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine enriched in the cytosolic leaflet. Although the ER is the main site for cholesterol synthesis, it has markedly low concentrations of sphingolipids [125]. Golgi synthesises sphingomyelin, a lipid not present in
the ER, but present in both the Golgi [126] and in the PM [127, 128]. The PM is also
enriched with densely packed sphingolipids and sterols [129]. Another factor influencing the sequence patterns of TMHs and their along the secretory pathway appears to
be the variation in membrane potentials [71, 72, 74].
Several sequence features can be assigned to anchor TMHs: Charged-residue flank
biases, leucine intra-helix asymmetry, and the “aromatic belt”.
We investigated the difference between TMHs from single-pass and multi-pass proteins and found significant differences in sequence composition that are reflective of the
biologically different roles the TMHs play. To emphasise and validate these findings,
we separated TMHs from single-pass proteins into simple and complex TMHs [26,

2.5. DISCUSSION

67

83]; ones that likely contains mostly TMHs that act as exclusive anchors, and another
that have roles beyond anchorage. This leaves us with “anchors” (simple TMHs from
single-pass proteins) and “non-anchors” (complex TMHs from single-pass proteins,
and TMHs from multi-pass proteins). If there are strong sequence feature differences
between anchors and non-anchors, it is likely that the sequence feature has a role in
satisfying membrane constraints to act as an energetically optimally stable anchor.
Future studies in the area would desirably directly include a comprehensive analyses
of datasets oligomerised TMHs from single-pass proteins and ascertain if they appear
to be more similar to simple anchors, multi-pass, or generally neither. Currently, no
sufficiently complete set of intra-membrane oligomerised single-pass proteins exists
that can be compared to a large set of known non-oligomerising proteins. The current
work sidesteps this issue by comparing single-pass proteins with simple TMHs, which
tend to be simple anchors (as shown in previous work [26, 83]), against datasets that
contain TMHs that will form intra-membrane bundles. Bluntly, the simple/complex
status of a TMH can be easily computed from its sequence with TMSOC whereas
the oligomerisation state of most membrane proteins still needs to be experimentally
determined.
Unsurprisingly, both positively and negatively charged residues can be seen to be
more strongly distributed with bias in anchors than non-anchors. Both the “positiveinside” rule as well as the “negative-outside/non-negative-inside” bias are mostly observable in simple single-pass TMHs (although they are statistically significant elsewhere). It is perhaps true that where a bias is clearly present in both non-anchors and
anchors alike, it is a strong topological determinant, whereas if the residue is only distributed with topological bias in exclusively anchoring TMHs, we can attribute these
features more specifically to biophysical anchorage. This being said, we should not
rule out that the same features aid topological determination since negative charge has
been shown to be a weaker topological determinant than positively charged residues
(35).
Tyrosine and tryptophan residues commonly are found at the interfacial boundaries
of the TMH and this feature is called the “aromatic belt” [6, 10, 15–17] and this was
thought to be caused by their affinity to the carbonyl groups in the lipid bilayer [130].
Not all types of aromatic residues are found in the aromatic belt; phenylalanine has no

68

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

particular preference for this region [16, 18]. It is still unclear if the aromatic belt has
to do with anchorage or with translocon recognition [6]. Here, TMHs with exclusively
anchorage functions showed stronger preferences for the W and Y in the aromatic belt
region, otherwise known as the water-lipid interface region than TMHs with function
beyond anchorage. This is strong evidence that the aromatic belt indeed assists with
anchorage, and is less conserved where the TMH must conform to other restraints
beyond membrane anchorage. Furthermore, we see that the tyrosine’s preference for
the inside interface region also appears to be to do with anchorage and this trend is
somewhat true for tryptophan, too.
Finally, our findings corroborate earlier reports that many multi-pass TMHs are
much less hydrophobic than typical single-pass TMH and about 30% of them fail the
hydrophobicity requirements of ∆G TMH insertion prediction (“missing hydrophobicity”) [15, 31, 121, 122]. We also find that the leucine skew and the hydrophobic
asymmetry towards the cytosolic leaflet of the membrane is more pronounced in simple,
single-pass TMHs than in complex or multi-pass ones; thus, it appears to be another
anchoring feature. It was found previously that the hydrophobic profiles of TMHs of
multi-pass proteins share similar hydrophobicity profiles on average irrespective of the
number of TMHs and TMHs from single-pass proteins have been found to be typically more hydrophobic than TMHs from multi-pass proteins [83]. Sharpe et al. [10]
report an asymmetric hydrophobic length for single-pass TMHs. Our study reiterates
the hydrophobic asymmetry and attributes it mainly to the leucine distribution. The
leucine asymmetry might be linked to the different lipid composition of either leaflet
of biological membranes.
In summary, three key features can be assigned to aiding TMH stability in the
membrane (Figure 2.10): (i) charge, (ii) the aromatic belt, and (iii) leucine leaflet
preference. What is most novel here is that each of these features are furthermore
distributed with preference for a particular side of the bilayer in the case of anchoring TMHs. These differences in inside-outside topology that are most present in anchoring TMHs further supports the notion that there are broad lipid compositional
differences between the inner and outer leaflets of the bilayers [10]. Furthermore, while
some TMHs conform and complement to the properties of the bilayer, other TMHs
with function beyond anchorage are less constrained to biophysically complement the

polar enrichment that flanks the hydrophobic stretch [6] and the aromatic belt [16]. b Simple anchors
may display additional features that conform to the membrane biophysical constraints: further suppression of charge in the hydrophobic core (Table 2.1), intra-membrane leucine asymmetry that likely
causes hydrophobic skew [10] (Table 2.4, Figure 2.6), a higher preference for cysteine on the inside
flanking region (Figure 2.9K and L), a higher net “positive-inside” charge (Figure 2.4), asymmetric
skew of the hydrophobic belt favouring the inner leaflet interface (Figure 2.9E, F, G, and H) and
a negative-outside bias via suppression on the inside flanking region or enrichment on the outside

bilayer. For these TMHs, any advantage gained by adhering to the membrane restrictions is outweighed by more complicated protein dynamics, topological frustration and
protein functional requirements.

To conclude, the large fraction of functionally uncharacterised genomic sequences is
the great bottleneck in life sciences at this moment that hinders many biomedical and
biotechnological applications, some with tremendous societal need [95, 131]. Among
these uncharacterised genomic regions, there is ∼10000 protein-coding genes, especially
many membrane-embedded proteins. It is hoped that the NNI/NO-rule as well as the
other sequence properties of membrane anchoring TMHs described in this article will
add new insights for membrane protein function discovery, design and engineering.

Methods

2.6.1

Datasets

Databases.
All datasets used for analysis are listed in Table 2.1. Transmembrane protein sequences
and annotations were taken from TOPDB [111] and UniProt [110]. UniProt derived
datasets are the most comprehensive datasets built with (i) robust transmembrane
prediction methods providing the limit of todays achievable accuracy with regard to
hydrophobic core localisation and (ii) subcellular location annotation that can be used
for orientation determination. However, they mostly rely on predicted transmembrane
regions. TOPDB has meticulous experimental verifications of the orientation from
the literature that are independent of prediction algorithms [111]. Unfortunately, this
dataset is much smaller with too few entries to have it divided with regard to taxonomy
or subcellular locations.
UniProt database files were downloaded by querying the server for different taxonomic groups as well as different subcellular membrane locations; UniHuman (human
representative proteome), UniCress (Arabidopsis thaliana, otherwise known as mouse
eared cress, representative proteome), UniER (human endoplasmic reticulum representative proteome), UniPM (human plasma membrane representative proteome),
UniGolgi (human Golgi representative proteome). To enforce a level of quality control,
the queries were restricted to manually reviewed records and transmembrane proteins
with manually asserted TRANSMEM annotation [110]. Proteins were then sorted
into multi-pass and single-pass groups according to having more than one or exactly
one TRANSMEM region respectively. TRANSMEM regions are validated by either
experimental evidence [110], or according to a robust transmembrane consensus of
the predictors TMHMM [40], Memsat [41], Phobius [42, 90] and the hydrophobic moment plot method of Eisenberg and co-workers [39]. TMHs and flanking regions were
oriented according to UniProt TOPO DOM annotation according to the keyword “cytoplasmic”. If a “cytoplasmic” TOPO DOM was found in the previous TOPO DOM
relative to the TRANSMEM region then the sequence remained the same. If “cytoplasmic” was found in the next TOPO DOM, relative to the TRANSMEM section

2.6. METHODS

71

then the sequence was reversed. Proteins without the “cytoplasmic” keyword in their
TOPO DOM annotation were omitted from further analysis.
The TOPDB database [111] is a manually curated database composed of experimental records from the literature that allow determination of the protein topology.
Experiments include fusion proteins, posttranslational modifications, protease experiments, immunolocalization, chemical modifications as well as revertants, sequence
motifs with known mandatory membrane-embedded topologies, and tailoring mutants
(Table 2.7).
Length cut-offs for the TMH were set at 16 as the shortest length and 38 as the
longest.
To note, we are aware that proteome datasets are a moving target that have dramatically changed over the years and, probably, will continue to do so to some extent
in the future[83]. Yet, we think that currently available protein sequence sets are sufficiently good for the purpose as we search for statistical properties in the TMH context
only.
The following datasets are used throughout this work:

ExpAll
TOPDB contained 4190 manually annotated transmembrane proteins at the time of
download [111]. CD-HIT [132] identified 3857 representative sequences using sequence
clusters of >90% sequence identity. This choice of similarity threshold was chosen since
CD-HIT ultimately underlies the clustering behind UniRef. Unlike the other datasets,
which by definition contain reasonably typical TMHs, many of the transmembrane
segments annotated in TOPDB are extremely short or long and this would cause
severe unrealistic hydrophobic mismatches. Especially, the short segments could be
the result of miss-annotation, TMHs broken into pieces due to kinks or segments that
peripherally insert only into the interface of the membrane bilayer. To remove the
atypical lengths, cut-offs were set at 16 as the lower cut-off and 38 as the upper cut-off
after inspecting the length histogram. We found that, for the single-pass TMHs in
TOPDB, 1215 out of 1544 are within the length limits (78.7%). Among the 17141
multi-pass TMHs, we find 15563 within our global length limits (from 2205 TOPDB
records corresponding to 2281 UniProt entries). This removed 1578 very short TMHs

and none of the long TMHs. Our cut-off selection is very similar to the one by BaezaDelgado et al. [6].
To get an idea of the taxonomical breakdown in the ExpAll dataset, the UniProt
ID tags were extracted and mapped to UniProtKB. The combined dataset of multipass (single-pass) proteins was mapped to 1288 (1343) eukaryotic records, 404 (776)
of which were human records, 926 (191) bacterial records, 46 (5) archaea records, and
14 (22) viral records.

UniHuman
This is a set of mostly human TMH-containing proteins or their close mammalian
homologues.

UniProtKB contains 5187 human protein records that are manu-

ally annotated with TRANSMEM regions (query = “annotation:(type:transmem)
AND reviewed:yes AND organism:“Homo sapiens (Human) [9606]” AND proteome:up000005640”. To reduce sequence redundancy, these sequences were submitted
to UniRef90 [133]. To note, UniRef90 was chosen over UniRef50 to maintain a viable
size of datasets for statistical analysis of occurrence of negatively charged residue,
which are very rare in the vicinity of TMHs. 5015 UniRef90 clusters represented the
5187 sequences. A list of sequences representing those clusters was submitted back
to UniProtKB resulting and 5014 representative entries were recovered. There is a
small issue in that the list of representatives from UniRef includes non-canonical isoforms, while the batch retrieve query of UniProtKB only supports complete entries, i.e.
canonical isoforms. This resulted in the loss of one record at this point is due to two
splice isoforms acting as representative identifiers. Of those 5014 records, 4714 were
records from human entries, 197 were from mice, 94 from rats, 5 from bovine, 2 from
chimps, 1 from Chinese hamsters, and 1 from pigs. Although the TMH length variations within the UniHuman dataset are much smaller than for ExpAll, we applied
the same length cut-offs for the sake of comparability. Out of the 1709 single-pass
cases, 1705 entered the final dataset. Of those, 1596 were from human records, 87
were from mouse, 19 were from rat, and 2 were from chimpanzee. Among the 12390
multi-pass TMHs, 12353 were included into UniHuman. The other, multi-pass record
identifiers were mapped to 1789 UniProtKB entries. 1660 of these were human entries,

63 from rat, 61 from mouse, 4 from bovine, and 1 from Chinese hamster. This clustered human dataset was then queried for subcellular locations to make the UniER,
UniGolgi, and UniPM datasets (detailed below).

UniER
The clustered UniHuman dataset was queried using UniProtKB for endoplasmic reticulum subcellular location (locations:(location:“Endoplasmic reticulum [SL-0095]” evidence:manual)). This returned 487 protein entries, 457 of which belonged to human,
24 to mouse and 6 to rat. 287 of these records contained sufficient annotation for
orientation determination. 132 were single-pass entries of which 120 records were from
humans, 11 from mouse, and 1 from rat. 155 were multi-pass entries containing 898
transmembrane helices. 144 were records from human, 8 were from mouse and 3 were
from rat.

UniGolgi
The clustered human dataset was queried using UniProtKB for Golgi subcellular location (locations:(location:“Golgi apparatus [SL-0132]” evidence:manual)). This returned 323 protein entries, 301 of which belonged to human, 19 to mice, 2 to rat and

mouse, and 1 from rat. 61 were multi-pass entries containing 383 transmembrane

The clustered human dataset was queried using UniProtKB for the cell membrane subcellular location (locations:(location:“Cell membrane [SL-0039]” evidence:manual)).
This returned 1036 protein entries, 948 of which belonged to humans, 62 to mice, and
26 to rats. 920 of these records contained sufficient annotation for orientation determination. 493 were single-pass entries of which 451 records were from human, 37 from

UniCress

For the mouse ear cress, a representative proteome dataset was acquired with the query
annotation:proteomes:(reference:yes) AND reviewed:yes AND organism:“Arabidopsis
thaliana (Mouse-ear cress) [3702]” AND proteome:up000006548. This returned 3174
records in UniProtKB. UniRef90 identified 3111 clusters. 3110 of the representative
sequences were mapped back to UniProtKB. Of those, 3090 were from Arabidopsis
thaliana, 2 from Hornwort, 1 from cucumber, 1 from tall dodder, 1 from soybean
(Glycine max), 2 from Indian wild rice, 2 from rice, 2 from garden pea, 1 from potato,
4 from spinach, 1 from Thermosynechococcus elongatus (thermophilic cyanobacteria),
1 from wheat, and 2 from maize. Of those there were 1146 with suitable TOPO DOM
annotation for topological orientation determination. 632 of those records were identified as single-pass, all of which were from Arabidopsis thaliana. 507 protein records
were from multi-pass records, which contained 3823 transmembrane helices. 506 of
those records were from Arabidopsis thaliana, whilst 1 was from Thermosynechococcus elongatus.

UniFungi

For the Fungi dataset, the query “annotation:(type:transmem) taxonomy:“Fungi

successfully mapped back to UniProtKB. Of those, 2070 had suitable annotation for
orientation. 1990 records belonged to Ascomycota including 1243 Saccharomycetales.
73 were Basidomycota, and 6 were Apansporoblastina. 729 records contained a single TMH region, 702 of which belonged to Ascomycota, 26 to Basidomycota and one
to Encephalitozoon cuniculi, a Microsporidium parasite. 8698 helices were contained
in 1338 records of multi-pass proteins. Of these records 1285 were Ascomycota, 47
were Basidomycota, and 5 were Apansporoblastina. One TMH from UniFungi was
discounted from P32897 due to an unknown position.

On the determination of flanking regions for TMHs and
the TMH alignment

The determination of the boundary point at the sequence between the TMH in a
membrane and the sequence immersed in the cytoplasm, extracellular space, vesicular
lumen, etc. is not that trivial as it initially appears. There is a lot of dynamics in
the TMH positioning and the actual boundary point will be represented by various
residues at different time points. Whilst the TMH core region detection from a sequence is trivial with modern software, the exact determination of TMH boundaries
remains difficult since it is unclear exactly how far in or out of the membrane a given
helix extends [86]. Previous studies have dealt with this issue in various ways [6, 7,
10, 134].
Here in this work, we explore two boundary definitions. First, we assign TMH
boundary locations as described in the respective databases. These flanks are the ones
that are reported in our TMH data files that are available at the WWW-site associated
with this paper. We studied flank lengths of ±5, ±10, and ±20 residues preceding
and following the inside and outside TMH boundaries. In these cases, the flanks are
aligned relative to the residue closest to the TMH.
In cases where the loops before and after the TMH are shorter than the predefined
flank lengths, further precautions are necessary. In the multi-pass datasets particularly
(Figure 2.11 & Figure 2.4), the flanks overlap with other membrane region flanks. We
explore several variants. On the one hand, we work with data files where the flank
residue stretches are equally truncated so that no overlap occurs. If the loop length was
uneven, the central odd residue was not included into any flank. We find surprisingly,
that a large number of TMH has no or just a super-short flank, a circumstance that
should disturb any statistical analysis due to the absence of objects. Therefore, we also
work with alternative datasets (i) with flanks overlapping between consecutive TMH
(e.g., in Table 3B; yet, it leads to some residues being counted more than one time)
as well as (ii) with subsets of the data where the flanks at both sides have a defined
minimal length (50% or 100% of the required flanks; unfortunately, some of them
become too small for analysis).

Figure 2.11: The lengths of flanks and TMHs in multi-pass and single-pass proteins in
the UniHuman and ExpAll dataset.On the horizontal axis are the lengths of the TM segment
regions in residues. On the vertical axis are the percentages of the population. There are three
regions: the inside flank, the TMH and the outside flank. These regions are acquired according to
the TMH boundary of the respective database. Where no overlap is permitted, if the flank encroaches
the flank of another TMH, the flank length becomes half the number of residues in the loop region
between the two features. Where they are allowed to overlap, flanking residues may include other
flanks, or indeed other TMHs.

The problem of flanks overlapping does affect also some single-pass and multipass TMH proteins with INTRAMEM regions as described in some UniProt entries.
We do not include INTRAMEM regions in the datasets as TMHs but, sometimes, the
flanking regions of TMHs were truncated to avoid overlap with INTRAMEM flanking
regions (Supplementary Table S2). The identifiers affected for single-pass TMH proteins are Q01628, P13164, Q01629, Q5JRA8, A2ANU3 (UniHuman), P13164, Q01629,
A2ANU3 (UniPM) and Q5JRA8 (UniER).
The second form of boundary point definition for flank determination was achieved
with gaplessly aligning all TMHs relative to their central residue at the position equal
to half the length of the TMHs at either side. Though there is some length variation
among TMHs, most of them are centred around a length of 20-22 residues. In this case,
flanks are the sequence extensions beyond the standardised-length 21-residues TMHs.
We define the inside flanking segments as the positions -20 to -10 and the outside
flanking regions to be +10 to +20 from the central TMH residue (with the label
“0”). Instead of emphasising some artificially selected boundary residue, this definition

2.6.3

Separating simple and complex single-pass helices.

Single-pass helices from ExpAll and UniHuman datasets helices were split into two
groups: simple and complex following a previously described classification [26, 83]
to roughly distinguish simple hydrophobic anchors and TMHs with additional structural/functional roles.

Simple and complex helices were determined using TM-

SOC [26]. The complexity class is determined by calculating the hydrophobicity
and sequence entropy. The resulting coordinates cluster with anchors being more
hydrophobic and less complex whilst more complex and more polar TMHs are associated with non-anchorage functions. In UniHuman there were 889 simple helices and
570 complex TMHs. In ExpAll there were 769 simple helices and 570 complex helices.

2.6.4

Distribution normalisation

In this work, we have used normalisation techniques described in previous investigations as well as new approaches designed to more sensitively identify biases of rare
residues. Baeza-Delgado and co-workers used LogOdds normalisation column-wise

80

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

in TMH alignments. Critically, this is based on their definition of probability, which
takes into account the total number of amino acids in the dataset as a denominator [6]. Since aliphatic residues such as leucine and other highly abundant slightly polar residues dominate the denominator, the distribution of the rare acidic residues will
be easily lost in the “background noise” of those highly abundant residues. Pogozheva
and co-workers used two approaches, (i) the total accessible surface area (ASAtotal)
and (ii) total number of charged residues (Ntotal ) as a denominator in their distribution
normalisation [7].
In this work, two methods for measuring residue occurrence in the TMH and its
flanks were used. Similarly to previous work, we compute the occurrence of an amino
acid type at a certain sequence position in a set of aligned sequences TMHs and their
flanks. Following [10], the absolute relative occurrence of this amino acid type at the
sequence position is then given by Equation 2.1 as:

pi,r =

ai,r
max(ar )

(2.1)

r

Here, the denominator is the maximal number of all residues in any alignment
column (i.e., the number of sequences in the alignment) and, to emphasise, this will
make mostly dependent on the most abundant residue types. This type of normalisation reveals the most preferred residue types at given sequence positions.
Our second normalisation method is independent of the abundance of any amino
acid types other than the studied one; it answers the question: “If there is a residue of
type in the TMH-containing segment, where would it most likely be?” This relative
occurrence calculated in Equation 2.2 as:

qi,r =

100 · ai,r
ai

(2.2)

The value ai is the total abundance of residues of just amino acid type i in a
given alignment of TMH-containing segments (i.e., in the TMH together with its two
adjoining flanks summed over all cases of TMHs in the given dataset). Peaks in qi,r
as function of r reveal the preferred positions of residues of type i. The difference in
qi,r and pi,r normalisation is visualised in Figure 2.12.

Figure 2.12: Relative percentage heatmaps from the predictive datasets calculated by
fractions of the absolute maximum and by the relative percentage of a given amino acid
type.The residue position aligned to the centre of the TMH is on the horizontal axis, and the residue
type is on the vertical axis. Amino acid types are listed in order of decreasing hydrophobicity according
to the Kyte and Doolittle scale [30]. The flank lengths in the TMH segments were restricted to up
to ±5 residues. The scales for each heatmap are shown beneath the respective subfigure. All TMHs
and flank lengths are from the UniHuman dataset. (A) The heatmap has been coloured according
to a scale that uses column-wise normalisations used in previous studies [10]. See Equation 2.1. As
an illustrative example, we show how the value for E at position ±12 is obtained. There are in total
91/22 Es at these positions in 1705 sequences; thus, the represented value is 0.013 at 12 and 0.053 at
12. Note that L is clearly a hotspot as well as trends for other hydrophobic residues, I and V, as is to
be expected. A positive inside effect can also be seen. (B) The heatmap has been coloured according
to the relative percentage of each amino acid type (Equation 2.2). Here, 91/22 Es at position ±12 are
compared with 615 Es seen within the flanks and the TMH section itself amongst all sequences in the
alignment. So, the expectation of an E at position ±12 if there is any E in the TMH + flanks region
at all is 0.036 at 12 and 0.148 at position 12. With this type of normalisation, not surprisingly, we
see the positive-inside rule is hotter than in subfigure A. There are also hotspots in the flanks for the
negatively charged residues on the outside flank. The leucine hotspot is no longer very pronounced,
as the leucines are quite evenly spread over many positions.

2.6.5

Hydrophobicity calculations

Hydrophobicity profiles were calculated using the Kyte & Doolittle hydrophobicity
scale [30] and validated with the Eisenberg scale [39], the Hessa biological scale [15],
and the White and Wimley whole residue scale [32](Figure 2.7). The hydrophobicity

82

CHAPTER 2. THE “NEGATIVE-OUTSIDE” RULE

profile uses un-weighted windowing of the residue hydrophobicity scores from end to
end of the TMD slice. Three residues were used as full window lengths and partial
windows were permitted.

2.6.6

Normalised net charge calculations

Charge was calculated at each position by scanning through each position of the transmembrane helices and flanking regions and subtracting one from the position if an
acidic residue (D or E) was present, or adding one if a positively charged residue (K or
R) was present. The accumulative net-charge was then divided by the total number
of transmembrane helices that were used in calculating the accumulative net-charge.
Thus, the charge distribution is calculated by:

cr =

2.6.7

(aK,r + aR,r ) − (aD,r + aE,r )
N

(2.3)

Statistics

The inside/outside bias of negative residues was quantified by computing the independent KW and the 2-sample t-test statistical method from the Python scipy stat package
v0.15 python package [135]. This test answers the question whether two means are actually different in the statistical sense. For the leucine residues, each TMH region was
divided into two sections, representing the inner and outer leaflets ( Table 2.4). For the
hydrophobicity plot, 3 window values of hydrophobicity were taken for each TMH at
each position. The statistical analyses were separately performed for single-pass and
multi-pass transmembrane proteins. At each position, the two groups were compared
using the KW test.
The zero hypothesis of homogeneity of two distributions was examined with the KS,
the KW and the χ2 statistical tests. To note, the KS test scrutinises for significant
maximal absolute differences between distribution curves; the KW test is after skews
between distributions and the χ2 statistical test checks the average difference between
distributions. As the statistical significance value (“Pvalue”) is a strong function of N,
the total amount of data used in the statistical test, we rely on the (absolute) Bahadur
slope (B) as a measure of distance between two distributions [113, 114]:

Tail-Anchored Protein Datasets

Abstract

3.2

Introduction

Tail Anchor (TA) proteins are defined by their single carboxy-terminal TMS with a
cytosolic facing amino-terminus and are a topologically distinct class of intracellular
proteins. TA proteins are involved in a range of key cellular functions such as translocation proteins [136] Sec61β and Sec61γ as well as the Bcl-2 apoptotic protein family
[137]. Additionally, within the TA class of proteins are a set of vesicle fusion proteins
called Soluble N-Ethylmaleimide-Sensitive Factor Attachment Receptor (SNARE) proteins [138], which contain typically hydrophobic TMHs [139]. The idea that SNARE
proteins are modular and capable of spontaneous insertion has significant implications
for both biomedical application in liposome-based drug delivery and can aid future
research for testing complex biological molecular networks [140, 141].
The TA protein’s TMH is unusual in that it is both the anchor and the targetting
factor for the ER [142]. Furthermore, the hydrophobicity appears to be a determining
factor in the delivery pathway that a TA proteins use for insertion [143, 144], for which
there is evidence demonstrating that are several mechanisms of translocation [144,
145](Figure 3.1).
TA proteins have several pathways for biogenesis in the ER membrane. TA proteins
were originally thought to be inserted into the membrane via different machinery than
the co-translational machinery, but unexpectedly SRP was found to be a factor for

or degradation of the TA protein. (4) A handful of TA proteins with relatively polar TMH regions have been observed spontaneously integrating into the

post-translational targetting confirmed by both cross-linking studies [146] and an in
vitro pull-down experiment [147]. SRP would deliver the TA protein to the membranebound SR in association with a highly conserved Sec translocon. Further cross-linking
experiments suggested Sec61 is also involved during TA protein membrane insertion
[148]. Previous studies had shown the Sec61 translocon is not necessary for TA protein
membrane integration by biochemical reconstitution experiments [142] and conditional
mutants in yeast [Steel2002, 149]. Nevertheless, this suggests the possibility of at least
one insertion mechanism that is related to the co-translational method of insertion.
A second possibly redundant system is also known to be involved in TA protein
biogenesis and is referred to as the TRC40 (also known as Asna1) pathway in mammals. A conserved homologue was found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Get3 [150], and
in yeast, this mechanism is generally referred to as the Get pathway. Unlike cotranslational insertion, the post-translational proteins do not couple with the ribosome, so
the TA protein must be exposed to the cytosolic environment for at least some time
[151]. At some point after the TA protein emerges from the ribosomal exit tunnel, the
TA protein TMH associates with Sgt2. An in vitro assay revealed that Sgt2 associates
with Get5 [152] as part of a dimerised Get4 and Get5 complex (two copies of each)[153–
156]. At this point Sgt2 either associates with preferential Get3 which targets the TA
protein for ER membrane biogenesis, or if there are excess TA proteins Sgt2 also associates with Bag6 which targets the TA protein for degradation [157]. This “race”
between Bag6 and Get3 ensures a level of quality control within the system. Assuming
the TA protein is not targetted for degradation, Get3 associates first with this complex
via an interaction with the N-terminal of Get4 [152]. A dimerised ADP-bound Get3
[Yamagata2009, 158–161] (TRC40) associates with and shields the C-terminal region of the TA protein [Stefanovic2007, Favaloro2008, 150]. This shielding may be
especially important since Get3 is involved in the folding of any nascent TA proteins,
which would be an unviable hydrophobic in the cytosol [Jonikas2009]. Fluorescence
studies revealed that tagged Get3 appears at both the cytosol and the ER membrane
so apparently shuttles the TA protein between the transmembrane complex of Get1
and Get 2 (WRB and CAML in mammalian cells), that contains cytosolic domains
that receive Get3, and Get4 Get5 Sgt2 complex [162, 163]. Yet it is an interesting
note that a single molecule fluorescence study revealed that the minimum machinery

3.2. INTRODUCTION

87

required for TA protein insertion from this system is a Get1 and Get2 heterodimer
[163].
Redundancy of the Get/TRC40 pathway and SRP pathway may be explained in
part by a novel SRP and Get independent pathway. This pathway utilises the Snd
protein pathway and was discovered in yeast [Aviram2016]. Snd1 binds to the TA
protein after it exits the ribosome and delivers it to the Snd2 and Snd3 membranebound complex which integrates the TA protein into the membrane.
In the absence of the Get machinery, Hsp40 and Hsc70 chaperones along with
ATP are also sufficient for enough biogenesis of TA proteins for viable cell growth
[Kemper2008, Meineke2008, Setoguchi2006, 143, 144, 164, 165]. In biological
systems, this is possibly used for mitochondrial delivery [Kemper 2008]. Chimeric
synaptobrevin, one of the first identified SNARE proteins, is capable of this spontaneous insertion if the tail anchor domain is replaced by the TM domains belonging to
a protein of known spontaneously inserting domains [141]. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that direct insertion TMHs thermodynamically mimics the energies
of TMHs integrated by the translocon [166] so in theory no integration machinery
is strictly necessary if the TMH can “correctly” interact with the membrane interface. Further, it was revealed that scrambling the TMH sequence, but maintaining
hydrophobicity, reduced the insertion potential of spontaneously inserting TMHs [167].
This phenomenon cannot, therefore, be explained entirely by the marginal hydrophobicity of the TMH.
The few peroxisomal TA proteins first associate with Pex19 which forms a complex
with the membrane-anchored Pex3 protein from which the TA protein is integrated
into the membrane [Yagita2013, 168, 169].
Given a “choice”, it is speculated that hydrophobicity determines the integration
pathway since Sec61β has a hydrophobic TMH and is targetted via the SRP pathway, whereas marginally hydrophobic TA proteins like cytochrome b5 and PTP1b can
spontaneously insert in vitro and biologically only rely on Hsp70 and Hsc40. Altering
the hydrophobicity, at least in the case of the spontaneously inserting PTP1b, also
determinates the localisation of the TA protein to either the mitochondrial membrane
or the ER membrane, or rather a more hydrophobic TA protein TMH is less likely
to localise to the mitochondrial membrane [170]. Broader analysis has shown that

88

CHAPTER 3. TAIL-ANCHORED PROTEIN DATASETS

hydrophobicity [32] stratified by TM tendency score [Zhao2009] can distinguish between the ER and mitochondrial localised TA proteins [151]. However, the tremendous
diversity and known biogenesis redundancy of these proteins may mean that no single
factor applied en masse may be able to distinguish the TMH recognition factors and
investigation into this area is becoming increasingly complex [151].
By regenerating a list of likely TMHs [139] and using a manually curated list of
TA proteins [110], this investigation aims to find relationships between biochemical
factors and a disposition to a certain insertion mechanism and terminal localisations.
Here, we also present evidence for a conserved polar strip along the spontaneously
inserting TA protein TMHs, which may be the key to the initial interaction of these
TMHs with the membrane interface.

Building a List of Tail-Anchors

Steps carried out by Kalbfleisch et al. published in Traffic 2007 (8: 16871694) [139],
were recreated using up to date tools. Whilst their study focused on the human
proteome, here we take into account the entire TrEMBL and SwissProt database and
then stratify the datasets by the organism at the end of the pipeline (Figure 3.2).

SwissProt Tail Anchored Dataset According to Filters
There were 557012 protein records downloaded from SwissProt via UniProt [110]
(Downloaded 24–04–2018). 106149 TMHs (TRANSMEM annotation) were found between 76953 records (annotation:(type:transmem)ANDreviewed:no). This keyword
is contained in a record according to either experimental evidence [110] or a robust
meta-analysis of TMH prediction using TMHMM [40], Memsat [41], Phobius [42, 90]
and the hydrophobic moment plot method of Eisenberg and co-workers [39]. 11141 of
those records had only a single TMH. 11110 of those TMHs were within the length
thresholds of 16 to 30 residues (None of those had the annotation for splice isoforms
according to NON_TER annotation). 5548 of those had had no SP annotation (SIGNAL).

cytoplasmic. 615 of those had the TMH within 25 residues of the C terminal, the same
threshold used by Kalbfleisch and their coworkers [139]. Running CD-Hit 4.5.3 on the
WebMGA web-server [132, 171] at 90% identical sequence at 90% coverage thresholds

CHAPTER 3. TAIL-ANCHORED PROTEIN DATASETS

resulted in 443 representative proteins. This threshold was chosen as a compromise
between avoiding over-representation of a certain protein and maintaining a viable
sample size.
From this representative list, 46 were Archaeal, 66 were bacterial, and 320 were
Eukaryotic and 11 came from dsDNA viruses. When counting proteomes with greater
than 20 records, 49 belonged to the A. thaliana proteome, 48 to Mouse, 46 to the
human proteome, 24 to S.cerevisiae.
65 were annotated under the Mitochondrion location (query locations:
(location:"Mitochondrion[SL-0173]")), 157 in the PM (query locations:
(location:"Cellmembrane[SL-0039]"),

82 in the Golgi (query locations:

(location:"Golgiapparatus[SL-0132]")), and 98 in the ER (query locations:
(location:"Endoplasmicreticulum[SL-0095]"). Only 16 records were found for
the peroxisome (query locations:(location:"Endoplasmicreticulum[SL-0204]")
which is not high enough a sample size for accurate statistical analysis.
TrEMBL Tail Anchored Dataset According to Filters
111425234 records were stored in the TrEMBL database at time of download (Downloaded 25–04–2018). 22107826 of those contained TRANSMEM annotation (annotation:
(type:transmem)ANDreviewed:no). 18053 of these were single-pass proteins. All of
these were within the length restrictions. 17973 of those did not contain a signal
sequence when looking for SIGNAL annotation. 5157 of those contained a cytoplasmically located N terminal according to TOPO_DOM annotation. 155 records had a TMH
within 15 residues of the C terminal residue. In those record’s annotations, no more
than 1 appeared in any given species, so they were omitted from the SwissProt list
sequence redundancy protocol to avoid representing a well-annotated record with a
poorly annotated record.
UniProt Curated List
A query for locations:(location:"Single-passtypeIVmembraneprotein[SL-9908]
") was used in UniProt which returned 2633 UniProtKB IDs; 463 SwissProt results
and 2170 TrEMBL results. Type IV anchors is sometimes split into two topological
groups; A (A cytosolic facing N terminal domain) and B (The N terminal is targeted

to the lumen), however the UniProt nomenclature is strictly N terminal being
cytosolic. This manually created list contained some TA proteins that didn’t fit the
generally accepted definition of a TA protein and were excluded from further analysis.
101 exceeded the TA length restrictions of 25 residues between the TMH and the
terminal residue. 8 contained annotation for SIGNAL, indicating a SP, inconsistent
with the TA protein definition. 20 were multipass proteins. A full list of which
records exceeded these limits and by how much is included in the supplementary files.
Running these records through CD-HIT at 90% redundancy yielded 956 clusters; 269
SwissProt records and 687 TrEMBL records [132, 171]. No further filters were applied
to this list. Proteomes represented by more than 20 records include A. thaliana (53
records), Humans (30), Mouse (30), and S. cerevisiae (27).
426 were annotated under the Mitochondrion location (query locations:
(location:"Mitochondrion[SL-0173]")) 47 from SwissProt and 379 automatically assigned in TrEMBL. 397 in the ER (query locations:(location:
"Endoplasmicreticulum[SL-0095]")), 88 from SwissProt and 308 automatically annotated in TrEMBL. 1 TrEMBL record (UniProt ID A0A1E5RT24) in the ER set
contained an “X” residue in the C terminal flank and was omitted from the analyses. Two subcellular location datasets had no automatically ascribed records and only
contained manually annotated SwissProt records; 31 in the PM (query locations:
(location:"Cellmembrane[SL-0039]"), and 83 in the Golgi (query locations:
(location:"Golgiapparatus[SL-0132]")). There were only 8 TA proteins located
in the peroxisome (locations:(location:"Golgiapparatus[SL-0204]")), making
them an unsuitable dataset for statistcal analysis.
Remapping Previous Dataset
189 of the 411 proteins from the previous Kalbfleisch et al., 2007 study [139] were
successfully mapped to 222 UniProtKB IDs using the UniProt mapping tools with the
RefSeq Protein to UniProtKB option [110].
Tail Anchor Protein Chaperone Interactors
These interactor lists were filtered through the SwissProt automatically filtered and
the UniProt curated TA protein datasets. There were 91 interaction pairs for Hsp40

92

CHAPTER 3. TAIL-ANCHORED PROTEIN DATASETS

(Biogrid ID 119699) which mapped to 206 UniProt records. Hsc70 (Biogrid ID 109544)
had 534 interaction pairs 61 of which were mapped to 91 UniProt records. Hsp40 and
Hsc70 both returned 0 record hits after filtering the UniProt records IDs through the
UniProt manually curated list and the automatically generated SwissProt list both
before redundancy removal.
Snd1 (Biogrid ID 32240) had 237 interaction pairs which mapped to 239 records.
Snd1 returned 15 hits when filtering it through the TA datasets.
SGT2 (BioGrid ID 34410) had 260 BioGrid interactor ids which mapped to 264
UniProt records. SGTA (BioGrid ID 112347) had 155 interactor ids from BioGrid,
153 of which were mapped to 274 records. SGT2 and SGTA returned 14 and 5 hits
respectively.
50 BioGrid ids from TRC40 (Biogrid ID 106931) interaction pairs were mapped to
90 UniProt records. Get3 (BioGrid ID 31962) had 456 Biogrid interactor ids, which
mapped to 465 UniProt records. After filtering those records through the TA anchor
datasets TRC40 and Get3 returned 7 and 22 hits respectively.
In yeast, Pex19 (BioGrid ID 31994) contained 466 interactor pairs which mapped
to 384 UniProt IDs. The human Pex19 (BioGrid ID 111782) contained 230 interaction
pairs which successfully mapped to 218 UniProt records. When the TA list filters were
applied, 2 human and 7 yeast records were found.
For SRP54, ideally the plant version of the protein was required, for which there
is more precedent for post-translational protein interaction and biogenesis into the
chloroplasts [146], however of the 3 plant SRPs available on Biogrid, between them
only 10 interactor pairs were available, none of which were common with our TA
lists. The human SRP54 (Biogrid ID 112607) had 37 interactors which mapped to 85
UniProt IDs, but again, none of which were in our TA lists. On the other hand, the
yeast SRP54 (BioGrid ID 36258) had 270 interactors which mapped to 273 UniProt
records. 4 of those were found in our TA lists.

Calculating Hydrophobicity

Windowed hydrophobicity was calculated using a window length of 5 residues, and half
windows were permitted. Average hydrophobicity takes the total of the raw amino
acid hydrophobicity values and divides them by the number of amino acids in the

3.3. METHODS

93

slice. Unless explicitly stated, values reported in the results are based on the Kyte &
Doolittle scale [30] which is based on the water–vapour transfer free energy and the
interior-exterior distribution of individual amino acids.

3.3.3

Calculating Sequence Information Entropy

Information entropy is essentially an estimate of the linguistic entropy of a string. In
the context of biology, it can be thought of as an estimation of the non-randomness of
a sequence. Sequence complexity can be used to analyse DNA sequences [44–46], and
is a component of the TMSOC z-score which can predict function beyond anchorage
of a TMH [26, 79, 83]. Here we focus on the analysis of the complexity of a string of
characters in protein sequences.
Broadly speaking, the information theory entropy of a linguistic string can be
defined as in equation 3.1, and we treat the protein sequence TMH as a string with or
without its flanking regions.
n
X
H(S) = −
pi logs (pi )

(3.1)

i=1

Where H is the entropy of a sequence S, and pi is the probability of a character
i through each position (n) in S. This allows us to quantify the average relative
information density held within a string of information [47].

3.3.4

Statistics

The null hypothesis of homogeneity of two distributions was examined with the Kolmogorov Smirnov, the Kruskal-Wallis, and the 2-sampled Student’s T-test statistical
tests. These tests were all ran through the Python SciPy stat package v0.17 python
package [135]. To note, the KS test scrutinises for significant maximal absolute differences between distribution curves; the KW test is after skews between distributions
and the student T-test statistical test checks the average difference between distributions.
Since the P value is a product of a fraction of test statistics obtained from a permutated set of the samples, it exponentially increases as N increases; the P -value is
a strong function of N . We rely on the Bahadur slope (B) as a measure of distance

94

CHAPTER 3. TAIL-ANCHORED PROTEIN DATASETS

between two distributions [79, 113–115]. A larger Bahadur slope shows a greater
difference between the two distributions.

B=

| ln(P value)|
N

(3.2)

In the heatmaps (Figure 3.6, Figure 3.7), the relative percentage normalisation was
used rather than a fraction of the absolute value. This aims to answer the question of
“if we have a certain amino acid, which position is it likely to be in?” and are able to
sensitively identify clusters of skewed preference [79].

qi,r =

ai

(3.3)

ai is the total abundance of residues of a specific amino acid type (i) of an aligned
set of TMH-containing segments. Peaks in qi,r as a function of r reveal the preferred
positions of residues of type i.

3.3.5

Modelling Cytochrome b5 and PTP1b

The HHpred web server was used to query homologues of and model templates for
Cytochrome b5 (UniProt accession code P00167) and PTP1b (UniProt accession code
P18031) [Soding 2005, Soding 2005a]. Homologues were queried using three iterations of HHblitscd against the sequence database version uniprot20 2016 02 to generate
the query Hidden Markov Model. The choice of templates was driven by the quality
and coverage of the alignments and of the quality of the models that resulted. For
cytochrome b5, a multiple alignment was generated from PDB accession codes 2M33,
2KEO, 3X34, 1MJ4, 1MJ4, 2IBJ covering the globular domain, and PDB accession
codes 5NAO, 5DOQ, 5NAM, and 2MMU covering the TMH. Modeller was run from
within the HHPRED server to generate the homology model [Zimmerman2017, 172,
173]. The model was confirmed to be of high quality using ProSA (Z-Score: -4.61)
[174], Ramachandran plot on the RAMPAGE webserver (98% allowed residues, including all TMH residues) [175].
The coverage and alignment quality of PTP1b was, however, not as good quality.
Although UniProt holds 145 associated PDB structures for PTP1b, these structures
cover at least some part of the globular domains of the protein. There are no PDB

3.4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

95

structures for the TM domain or the nearby flanking regions. Instead of a global protein model only the Trans-membrane Domain (TMD) was modelled using a homology
model derived from a single sequence alignment of 5NAO based on the TMH±6 (the
length of the C-terminal tail) residues of PTP1b .
APBS as a PyMol plugin was used to map the electrostatic surface of the model
[176]. Consurf [177] was used to map the conservation scores based on 5 iterations
of PSI-BLAST [178] with an E-value cut-off of 0.0001. Hydrophobicity was mapped
according to the Eisenberg aggregated hydrophicity scale [39] using a script accessed
at https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Color_h.

Results And Discussion
A Comparison Of Up-To-Date Tail-Anchored Protein
Datasets

Here, we use two sources for TA protein datasets. One dataset is based on a previous
method [139] to obtain TA datasets and consists of 9296 TMH residues (13279 including up to ±5 flanking residues) from 443 SwissProt entries with 90% redundancy
removal. Another dataset contains the UniProt curated set of Type IV membrane proteins again with 90% redundancy removal. This dataset contains 20528 TMH residues
(27950 including up to ±5 flanking residues) from 956 UniProt protein records.
In order to get an understanding of the consistency of the datasets, before removing
redundant proteins, we compared these two datasets to a dataset remapped set of
proteins from a previous 2007 method [139]. The S1 dataset was built with an aim
to gather TA proteins in the human genome from the NCBI. The greatest source
of uncertainty here is that the original S1 list includes 411 records, however, only
222 of these were successfully mapped to the UniProt dataset. This figure is closer
to the 202 proteins from the original S1 list that excluded proteins that were either
hypothetical or splice isoforms. That being said, this mapping step prevents us from
directly comparing the entire original S1 dataset. We compared the up-to-date datasets
to S1 to see how many records are shared, how many are now obsolete, and how many
are unique.

analysis.

3.4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

97

Figure 3.3 shows that S1 has 175 record ids of 222 records (78.8%) which do not
share overlap the up-to-date manually curated UniProt dataset [110]. Of the 170
unique records of that S1 dataset, 4 were manually annotated as not belonging to the
human proteome, 20 have the C terminal as annotated being cytoplasmic, only 125
had TRANSMEM annotation indicating a bona fide TMH. If we apply equivalent filters,
only 42 have annotation verifying that they are TA proteins.
Equivalent criteria to the original Kalbfleisch et al., 2007 [139] study were applied
to the entire SwissProt database and then restricted to the human proteome dataset.
24 of these 47 records (51.1%) are in the curated UniProt TA dataset. 21 of the 49
(44.7%) records from SwissProt filtered human dataset can be found in the original
S1 list.
The same method applied to an up-to-date dataset overlaps more with a manually
curated dataset. There is also a large degree of what we now believe to be mistakes
that occurred in the older prediction tools and datasets, even when using similar
methods. As a trend, this shows that up-to-date datasets improve the reliability of
this automated predicted method. These automated criteria still do not fully align with
the manually curated list. Of 2633 records, only 2241 have the TRANSMEM annotation.
Ultimately, this points to the idea that datasets are a moving target as they are
constantly updated with more accurate information using evermore reliable tools and
methods.

3.4.2

It Is Difficult To Observe Any Hydrophobic Variation
Of TA Protein TMHs From Different Species

In single-pass proteins of eukaryotic species, there are typically various adaptations
of the TMH to adhere to the membrane constraints of the specific membrane. For
single-pass proteins, previous studies have observed differences in terms of TMH hydrophobicity between yeast and human TMPs [10], or in cress, yeast, bacteria, and
human datasets [79]. We would expect to see a similar trend between the TMHs of
TA proteins from different species. However, when assuming a zero-difference hypothesis, in these TMH TA protein datasets we cannot observe any species-level differences
between the datasets at this sample size for TMH hydrophobicity.

98

CHAPTER 3. TAIL-ANCHORED PROTEIN DATASETS
When comparing the average Kyte & Doolittle [30] hydrophobicity values for

the TMHs from humans and mice, A. thaliana, and S. cerevisiae, we can see little
difference between the mean values. All of the mean values lie between 2.3-2.6 when
we only consider the TMH and at 1.3-1.6 when considering residues in close proximity
to the TMH (±5 residues) (Figure 3.4).

CHAPTER 3. TAIL-ANCHORED PROTEIN DATASETS

Here, we are dealing with datasets at least an order of magnitude smaller than
those broad studies [10, 79] which could explain the absence of the effect. However,
this only goes to show that if there is a biochemically distinct effect in TA proteins in
terms of hydrophobicity between species, it is indeed weak.

3.4.3

There Are Biochemical Differences Between TailAnchored TMHs From Different Organelles

As is typically in the case of species, TMHs with different subcellular localisations
on average have different hydrophobicity. This could be in part due to the variation
in membrane potential across the different organelles [71, 72, 74], the known lipid
asymmetry caused by sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids on the non-cytosolic leaflet
and phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine in the cytosolic leaflet in the
Golgi and PM and lack of asymmetry in the ER [123, 124], or that sphingomyelin is not
present in the ER but is present in the Golgi [126] and PM [127, 128]. Furthermore,
the PM contains densely packed sphingolipids and sterols [129].
These hydrophobic differences have already been observed in the mitochondria
localised TA protein TMH [179]. Here we consider the TA proteins at certain locations
within the cell ignoring species, and we see clear differences in the biochemistry of the
TMH. In the UniProt manually curated dataset, the Kyte & Doolittle hydrophobicity
scores rage from 1.7 in mitochondria to 2.7 in the PM (Figure 3.5A).
Table 3.3: Statistical comparisons between TMH sequences from organelles in the
UniProt Curated Dataset. Here, we compare an organelle subset from the UniProt curated
dataset of TA proteins. We compare ER (N=397) to Golgi (N=83), PM (N=31), and the mitochondria (N=426). The hydrophobicity was predicted as the mean average of the values of the sequences
of the TMH, as well another group including up to ±5 flanking residues, since predicting the boundary of TMHs is difficult, according to the Kyte & Doolittle hydrophobicity scale [30]. The linguistic
information entropy was calculated according to the methods section [47]. The Test column refers to
the statistical score obtained from the test; H statistic for the Kruskal Wallis (KW), the KS statistic
for the Kolmogorov Smirnov test (KS), and the t-statistic for the student’s T-test (T-test). P is the
P-value of that statistical score. B refers to the Bahadur slope, an interpretation of the P-value that
accounts for the sample size powering the test [113, 114].

CHAPTER 3. TAIL-ANCHORED PROTEIN DATASETS

In the UniProt curated list, there are clear hydrophobic differences between all the
organelle TMH datasets excluding flanks (P < 2.98E − 6) which as a trend becomes
less clear when considering the TMH±5 flanking residues except for mitochondria
which increases in significance when considering the flanks also (Table 3.3). The
ER and mitochondrial tests are very significant (P < 4.22E − 82). Consistently the
Bahadur slope is at least an order of magnitude greater in the ER and mitochondrial
comparison than for the other considerations, so these differences cannot be accounted
for by the larger sample size. This gap in hydrophobicity appears to be due to a
trend of the ER, PM, and Golgi using isoleucine, valine, and leucine as their most
common TMH residues, whereas in the case mitochondrial located TA proteins, the
most common residue type is alanine in the UniProt manually curated dataset (16.3%
of total residues) followed by valine (12% total residues)(Figure 3.6).
Similarly, alanine is the second most common residue in mitochondrial located TA
proteins from the Swissprot automatically generated dataset at 11.9% of the total
residues after leucine which is 13.4% of the total residues(Figure 3.7).
Analysis from 16 TA proteins with known subcellular locations showed that both
the C-terminal tail charge and hydrophobicity are determinates of the terminal destination to the ER, mitochondria, and the peroxisome intra-cellular sub-cellular locations
[169]. They found that less hydrophobicity and more charge in the “tail” determined
the TA protein for the mitochondria rather than the ER. This corroborates what we
see in terms of hydrophobicity (Figure 3.5A). When we consider charge difference between organelles on larger datasets, we see trends that reinforce this idea, however
rather than net charge, we see charge distribution along the TMH and the neighbouring flanks. In the Swissprot automatically filtered dataset, in the ER 9.4% of the
residues are positively charged, and 2.5% are negatively charged. Most of the positively charged residues cluster following the “positive-inside” rule between positions
-15 and -10 for R and K, but so do the negatively charged residues D and E, effectively
reducing this local charge by 2.5%. In mitochondria, we find that the proportion of
charge is similar (10.4% R and K, 3.3% D and E) however the negatively charged
residues cluster on the N flank (-15 to -8) and the positively charged residues cluster
more strongly on the outside flank (positions 9 to 15) (Figure 3.7).
In the UniProt manually curated ER set, 6.6% of residues are positively charged

datasets are more thoroughly outlined in the methods section.

CHAPTER 3. TAIL-ANCHORED PROTEIN DATASETS

and 3.3% of residues are negatively charged. K clusters strongly on the inside flank
as expected, yet R clusters strongly between positions 7 to 15 and rather weakly at
the inside flank (positions -15 to -10) (Figure 3.6). Similarly to the SwissProt sets,
D prefers the inside flank but is tolerated in the outside flank. The more abundant
E residues behave very unusually and cluster at positions 5-10. Generally, charged
residues are supressed in the TMH core [6, 10], especially in anchoring TMHs [79].
It is unclear why this is observed, yet, altogether the 313 glutamic acid residues and
397 arginine residues that appear unusually deep in the TMH core may be to an
extent neutralising one another in the folded TMH arrangement, but are ultimately
not that abundant compared to the total number of residues in this organelle dataset
(11351 total residues). In mitochondria 1413 positively charged residues (11% of the
total residues in the mitochondrial dataset) were preferentially located at the outside
flank and somewhat into the core (positions 6 to 15) than the expected “inside” flank
(positions -15 to -5). The 221 negatively charged residues (1.7%) unusually cluster at
the inside. This results in a strong net positive-outside charge signal.
Information entropy has been known to identify cryptic function in TMHs when
considered along with hydrophobicity [26, 83]. In terms of information entropy, there
is a marked decrease in entropy in the PM subset (mean entropy = 3.15 in the TMH,
2.67 including ±5 flanking residues) from the UniProt curated dataset compared to the
other organelle datasets (entropy > 3.29 and > 2.85 including the flanks). However this
stark difference between TMHs from PM bound TA proteins and the other organelle
datasets cannot be observed in the SwissProt set (Figure 3.5).
No clear significant differences can be observed for the information entropy (P >
6.33E − 2). This is unsurprising given that the hydrophobic nature of the TMHs
demands that certain residues must be over-represented, which lowers the information entropy. In this case, we have a highly hydrophobic set, the PM UniProt set,
which likely contains a higher proportion of the most hydrophobic residues. As a
trend the information entropy mirrors the hydrophobicity albeit with less range between dataset means (2.67-3.15 in the TMH for information entropy, 1.72-2.74 for
hydrophobicity)(Figure 3.5).
Similarly, in the SwissProt filtered dataset the mean TMH hydrophobicity for mitochondria is the lowest at 1.9, but it appears to be the Golgi apparatus that is the

peak at 2.4. In the SwissProt dataset, when we compare each subset of only the TMH
to the ER subset, we find significance between the ER and the Golgi (P < 1.98E − 3),
and the ER and the mitochondria (P < 4.62E − 3), however the ER and PM are
more similar considering the Bahadur values are < 6.44E − 4, two orders of magnitude
smaller that the other sets (Bahadur values > 3.3E − 2) (Table 3.4). When we take
into account the flanks, the ER and PM dataset can be distinguished (P < 2.50E − 3),
however as a trend the other two comparisons, ER and Golgi becomes less significant,
and ER and mitochondria become more significant.
The information entropy of the TMH string was also examined. No significance
was observed in any consideration of the information entropy, but similarly to the
UniProt subset, as a trend, the entropy mirrors the hydrophobicity (Figure 3.5).
It has been known for some time that both the charge and the hydrophobic length
of the TA protein TMH region determine subcellular targetting of the protein [179].
The C-terminal tail charge is particularly important for determining subcellular localisation, and can even override the hydrophobic signal if strong enough [169]. Here we
see that while hydrophobicity is statistically different between the subcellular membranes, there is overlap. Whilst there are differences in total average charge at the
C-terminal flank, this is not an absolute rule.
Average biochemical features are evidently of significance, however here we see that

3.4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

107

the tandem in positively and negatively charged residues and the localisation of signals
and features along the TMH and flanks may be another nuance of the system and go
some way to explaining how signals are maintained in local environments even when
the average values are ambiguous. We also identify that alanine is a key reason behind
the hydrophobic difference between subcellular organelles, with alanine being highly
tolerated, if not favoured over other hydrophobic residues like leucine, in mitochondrial
TA proteins compared to ER, the Golgi, and the PM.

3.4.4

More annotation is required to identify chaperonespecific factors.

TA proteins known to interact with certain chaperones were acquired by filtering the
interactor partner IDs for chaperones from BioGrid through the redundant versions of
these UniProt manually curated lists and Swissprot automatically generated lists.
Hsp40, Hsc70, SRP54 (both plant and human) returned 0 hits, indicating a lack
of annotation regarding TA proteins with these chaperons probably due to the relatively polar, and non-trivially predictable, TMHs of TA proteins that these chaperones
interact with.
Snd1 has 15 records that were in our TA lists. The average Kyte & Doolittle
hydrophobicity of these records was 2.60 in the TMH itself and 1.58 including ± 5
flanking residues. Sgt2, with 14 records, had a TMH hydrophobicity of 2.47 and 1.51
including the flanks. 5 records were captured for SGTA with a TMH hydrophobicity of
2.27 and 1.19 including the flanks. TRC40 had the highest TMH hydrophicity of 2.77
and 1.82 including flanks. However, TRC40 also only had 7 records. Get3 had 22 TA
interactor records with an average TMH hydrophobicity of 2.36 and 1.48 including the
flanks. The 2 records for human Pex19 had an average hydrophobicity of 1.33 for the
TMH and 0.70 including the flanking residues. The yeast Pex19 had a TMH average
hydrophobicity of 2.48 and 1.41 including the flanking residues. The 4 yeast SRP54
interactors had an average TMH of 2.43 and 1.98 including the flanking residues.
At the time of the investigation, these sample sizes are not statistically viable
for analysis. Whilst it appears TRC40 interactors have notably hydrophobic TMHs,
TRC40s yeast homologue Get3 has interactors with much more polar TMHs, yet SGTA

108

CHAPTER 3. TAIL-ANCHORED PROTEIN DATASETS

was lower than SGT2 on average. So although these average values differ and overlap
between various chaperone systems, we tried to identify clearer patterns from the TMH
hydrophobic profiles (Figure 3.8). Similarly, whilst a clear dip in hydrophobicity at
position +5 in Get3 from 2-3 across the rest of the TMH core to 0.32, there is no such
spike for TRC40 meaning this is probably not of any functional importance, but rather
an artefact of overrepresented proteins in the Get3 dataset. Snd1 also lies among these
values, reinforcing Snd1 as a biological redundancy system [144, 145, 150].
As expected, the human Pex19 interactors are as a trend among the most polar
throughout the TMH core, however, when we consider the yeast Pex19, this trend is
less clear.
It is also encouraging that at least at a handful of locations (-3, 3, 4 and 5) the
SRP54 interactors have the most hydrophobic TMH cores.
In order to remove redundant proteins and investigate this further, more records
with greater levels of accurate annotation need to be available to both BioGrid and
UniProt. We also observe a great deal of overlap between the profiles, indicating that
as a trend this is more complex than hydrophobicity alone, or at least polarity is not
the absolute determinant of subcellular targetting. Hydrophobicity alone would have
resulted in stark contrasts between chaperone interactor pairs, even with low sample
sizes.
However, this method demonstrates a potential way that this chaperone-interaction
problem can be investigated to verify that indeed hydrophicity plays a deterministic
role in chaperone selection.

3.4.5

Spontaneous Insertion May Be Achieved by Polar
Strips in the TMH of Tail-Anchored Proteins

The TMH of cytochrome b5 and PTP1b are among the most hydrophobic of the TA
proteins and in theory misses the ∆G requirements of a TMH [143, 144]. Indeed
the TMH is not trivial to predict and is not found in either dataset prepared herein.
Structural modelling and analysis thereof reveal features that may explain the “missing
hydrophobicity” [15, 31, 121, 122] of these particular TMHs.

TMH residue defined by UniProt. On the vertical axis is the Kyte & Doolittle hydrophobicity
windowed across 5 residues allowing for half windows. The chaperone interactors are colour coded
according to the key.

The electrostatic surfaces are proto-typical of a TMH anchor with large “positiveinside” patches [6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 79] and a strong “negative-outside” charge [79](Figure
3.9C). Once in the membrane, this may allow it to be an effective anchor despite such
poor hydrophobicity since it satisfies electrostatic coupling to the membrane potential.

Furthermore is the question of overcoming the unfavourable interaction most TMHs
would face when coming into contact with the highly polar membrane interface. We
observe a highly conserved strip of relatively polar / non-hydrophobic residues on one
side of the TMH core (in cytochrome b5 these are N112, P116, A120, A124 Y127, and
R128). Similarly a polar face exists for the PTP1b TMH (R430, N434, Y426, T422,
and T419). These polar faces would not be as repulsed by the interfacial environment
as either a more hydrophobic TMH or a similarly hydrophobic TMH with a different
sequence and structure order (Figure 3.9 and Figure 3.10). Scrambling the TMH
sequence whilst maintaining the same hydrophobicity reduces the insertion potential
[167]; there is more to it than hydrophobicity alone. It becomes apparent that the 3D
arrangement of these relatively polar TMH residues is conserved and is probably the
key to spontaneous insertion of TMHs.

3.5

Summary

Here, we have observed large biochemical distinction between TA proteins with different terminal destinations. Previously it was known that both hydrophobicity and
charge are involved in targetting [169]. In this study we find that the location of
the charge along and around the TMH is different in different subcellular compartments. Crucially, there is a shift in the charged residue inside-outside tandem in the
TMH flanking residues in different organelles which in mitochondria goes against the
membrane-potential electrostatic coupling. Furthermore, the missing hydrophobicity
of mitochondrial TA proteins can be in part attributed to the high abundance of alanine rather than leucine or isoleucine in the TMH. We expected to see evolutionary

adaptations of TMH hydrophobicity to species-specific membranes, even within eukaryotes [10, 79]. In this study using both a manually curated dataset from UniProt
and an automatically filtered list using SwissProt annotation, we do not observe any
strong differences. Since we could not scrutinise a difference in the species, the strong
hydrophobic differences between organelle TMHs are indicative of a stronger adaptation pressure than between species. These differences are likely to be partially adaptations to the organelle location membrane type and also possible cryptic biological

112

factors that play a role in their targeting via chaperone-binding affinity. This could be
a functional similarity to the signal-anchored proteins. Signal anchored proteins contain a single hydrophobic segment that serves as both a mitochondrial targeting signal
and a membrane anchor. Signal anchored proteins, along with some TA proteins, have
been shown to be able to spontaneously insert into the membrane independently from
the translocon [50, 165, 180].
We could not find any clear trends or perform statistical work on the interactor
datasets due to the small sample sizes, however, as the databases are enriched, this
same method will be able to answer the questions about chaperone affinity with more
accuracy in the future.
Furthermore, the spontaneously inserting TA proteins PTP1b and cytochrome b5
appear to share a polar face that emerges in structural models and a strong positiveinside negative-outside electrostatic surface. The polar face may be responsible for
the promotion insertion potential in the absence of insertion proteins, since when the
sequence is scrambled, the insertion potential is reduced [167]. The positively and
negatively charged residues are distributed like an ideal anchoring TMH [79] which
could allow the marginally hydrophobic TMH to perform as a suitable membrane
anchoring feature.

Discussion

GPCRs have long be known to be overrepresented among genomes [181].
Seen across a variety of 7TM families with varying functions with datasets built
from all membrane types (hence variety). Suggests a pressure for simpler TMHs to
precede more complex ones, repeating every 3-4 TMHs. The universality points toward
translocon behaviour pressure, or thermodynamic stability in the membrane. Would
we expect this behaviour if the translocon acted on only one TMH at a time?

Outlook
The hydrophobicity–sequence complexity continuum

We hypothesise that the hydrophobicity–sequence complexity continuum contains nuanced codes for different functions and that such differentiation of sequence and structural properties will allow assignment to these varying functions. Additionally, we
suggest probing functional classification of yet uncharacterised membrane proteins by
similarities of combinations of complex TM sets to well studied membrane proteins and
finding those classes of TM proteins where this principle is most directly applicable.
