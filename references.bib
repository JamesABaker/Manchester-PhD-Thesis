abstract = {Tail-anchored (TA) proteins are transmembrane proteins with a single C-terminal transmembrane domain, which functions as both their subcellular targeting signal and membrane anchor. We show that knockout of TRC40 in cultured human cells has a relatively minor effect on endogenous TA proteins, despite their apparent reliance on this pathway in vitro These findings support recent evidence that the canonical TRC40 pathway is not essential for TA protein biogenesis in vivo We therefore investigated the possibility that other ER-targeting routes can complement the TRC40 pathway and identified roles for both the SRP pathway and the recently described mammalian SND pathway in TA protein biogenesis. We conclude that, although TRC40 normally plays an important role in TA protein biogenesis, it is not essential, and speculate that alternative pathways for TA protein biogenesis, including those identified in this study, contribute to the redundancy of the TRC40 pathway.},

abstract = {Recently, understanding of protein targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was expanded by discovery of multiple pathways that function in parallel to the signal recognition particle (SRP). GET (guided entry of tail-anchored proteins) and SND (SRP independent) are two such targeting pathways described in yeast. So far, no human SND component is functionally characterized. Here, we report hSnd2 as the first constituent of the human SND pathway able to support substrate-specific protein targeting to the ER. Similar to its yeast counterpart, hSnd2 is assumed to function as a membrane-bound receptor preferentially targeting precursors carrying C-terminal transmembrane domains. Our genetic and physical interaction studies show that hSnd2 is part of a complex network of targeting and translocation that is dynamically regulated. This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {Zn(2+) plays essential roles in biology, and cells have adopted exquisite mechanisms for regulating steady-state Zn(2+) levels. Although much is known about total Zn(2+) in cells, very little is known about its subcellular distribution. Yet defining the location of Zn(2+) and how it changes with signaling events is essential for elucidating how cells regulate this essential ion. Here we create fluorescent sensors genetically targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi to monitor steady-state Zn(2+) levels as well as flux of Zn(2+) into and out of these organelles. These studies reveal that ER and Golgi contain a concentration of free Zn(2+) that is 100 times lower than the cytosol. Both organelles take up Zn(2+) when cytosolic levels are elevated, suggesting that the ER and Golgi can sequester elevated cytosolic Zn(2+) and thus have the potential to play a role in influencing Zn(2+) toxicity. ER Zn(2+) homeostasis is perturbed by small molecule antagonists of Ca(2+) homeostasis and ER Zn(2+) is released upon elevation of cytosolic Ca(2+) pointing to potential exchange of these two ions across the ER. This study provides direct evidence that Ca(2+) signaling can influence Zn(2+) homeostasis and vice versa, that Zn(2+) dynamics may modulate Ca(2+) signaling.},

abstract = {The factors contributing to the establishment of the steady state Golgi pH (pH(G)) were studied in intact and permeabilized mammalian cells by fluorescence ratio imaging. Retrograde transport of the nontoxic B subunit of verotoxin 1 was used to deliver pH-sensitive probes to the Golgi complex. To evaluate whether counter-ion permeability limited the activity of the electrogenic V-ATPase, we determined the concentration of K(+) in the lumen of the Golgi using a null point titration method. The [K(+)] inside the Golgi was found to be close to that of the cytosol, and increasing its permeability had no effect on pH(G). Moreover, the capacity of the endogenous counter-ion permeability exceeded the rate of H(+) pumping, implying that the potential across the Golgi membrane is negligible and has little influence on pH(G). The V-ATPase does not reach thermodynamic equilibrium nor does it seem to be allosterically inactivated at the steady state pH(G). In fact, active H(+) pumping was detectable even below the resting pH(G). A steady state pH was attained when the rate of pumping was matched by the passive backflux of H(+) (equivalents) or "leak." The nature of this leak pathway was investigated in detail. Neither vesicular traffic nor H(+)/cation antiporters or symporters were found to contribute to the net loss of H(+) from the Golgi. Instead, the leak was sensitive to voltage changes and was inhibited by Zn(2+), resembling the H(+) conductive pathway of the plasma membrane. We conclude that a balance between an endogenous leak, which includes a conductive component, and the H(+) pump determines the pH at which the Golgi lumen attains a steady state.},

Features in transmembrane domains such as charged residues in ion channels are often functionally important, but could pose a challenge during cotranslational membrane insertion and folding. Our systematic proteomic approaches in both yeast and human cells revealed that the ER membrane protein complex (EMC) binds to and promotes the biogenesis of a range of multipass transmembrane proteins, with a particular enrichment for transporters. Proximity-specific ribosome profiling demonstrates that the EMC engages clients cotranslationally and immediately following clusters of TMDs enriched for charged residues. The EMC can remain associated after completion of translation, which both protects clients from premature degradation and allows recruitment of substrate-specific and general chaperones. Thus, the EMC broadly enables the biogenesis of multipass transmembrane proteins containing destabilizing features, thereby mitigating the trade-off between function and stability.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Tail-anchored (TA) proteins insert into their target organelles by incompletely elucidated posttranslational pathways. Some TA proteins spontaneously insert into protein-free liposomes, yet target a specific organelle in vivo. Two spontaneously inserting cytochrome b5 forms, b5-ER and b5-RR, which differ only in the charge of the C-terminal region, target the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM), respectively. To bridge the gap between the cell-free and in cellula results, we analyzed targeting in digitonin-permeabilized adherent HeLa cells. In the absence of cytosol, the MOM was the destination of both b5 forms, whereas in cytosol the C-terminal negative charge of b5-ER determined targeting to the ER. Inhibition of the transmembrane recognition complex (TRC) pathway only partially reduced b5 targeting, while strongly affecting the classical TRC substrate synaptobrevin 2 (Syb2). To identify additional pathways, we tested a number of small inhibitors, and found that Eeyarestatin I (ESI) reduced insertion of b5-ER and of another spontaneously inserting TA protein, while not affecting Syb2. The effect was independent from the known targets of ESI, Sec61 and p97/VCP. Our results demonstrate that the MOM is the preferred destination of spontaneously inserting TA proteins, regardless of their C-terminal charge, and reveal a novel, substrate-specific ER-targeting pathway.},

abstract = {LITAF (LPS-induced TNF-activating factor) is an endosome-associated integral membrane protein important for multivesicular body sorting. Several mutations in LITAF cause autosomal-dominant Charcot Marie Tooth disease type 1C. These mutations map to a highly conserved C-terminal region, termed the LITAF domain, which includes a 22 residue hydrophobic sequence and flanking cysteine-rich regions that contain peptide motifs found in zinc fingers. Although the LITAF domain is thought to be responsible for membrane integration, the membrane topology of LITAF has not been established. Here, we have investigated whether LITAF is a tail-anchored (TA) membrane-spanning protein or monotopic membrane protein. When translated in vitro, LITAF integrates poorly into ER-derived microsomes compared with Sec61$\beta$, a bona fide TA protein. Furthermore, introduction of N-linked glycosylation reporters shows that neither the N-terminal nor C-terminal domains of LITAF translocate into the ER lumen. Expression in cells of an LITAF construct containing C-terminal glycosylation sites confirms that LITAF is not a TA protein in cells. Finally, an immunofluorescence-based latency assay showed that both the N- and C-termini of LITAF are exposed to the cytoplasm. Recombinant LITAF contains 1‚ÄÖmol/mol zinc, while mutation of predicted zinc-binding residues disrupts LITAF membrane association. Hence, we conclude that LITAF is a monotopic membrane protein whose membrane integration is stabilised by a zinc finger. The related human protein, CDIP1 (cell death involved p53 target 1), displays identical membrane topology, suggesting that this mode of membrane integration is conserved in LITAF family proteins.},

In our tests, PRODIV-TMHMM outperforms earlier methods both when evaluated on ‚Äúlow-resolution‚Äù topology data and on high-resolution 3D structures. The results presented here indicate that the topology could be correctly predicted for approximately two-thirds of all membrane proteins using PRODIV-TMHMM. The importance of evolutionary information for topology prediction is emphasized by the fact that compared with using single sequences, the performance of PRODIV-TMHMM (as well as two other methods) is increased by approximately 10 percentage units by the use of homologous sequences. On a more general level, we also show that HMM-based (or similar) methods perform superiorly to methods that focus mainly on identification of the membrane regions.},

abstract = {An inherent problem in transmembrane protein topology prediction and signal peptide prediction is the high similarity between the hydrophobic regions of a transmembrane helix and that of a signal peptide, leading to cross-reaction between the two types of predictions. To improve predictions further, it is therefore important to make a predictor that aims to discriminate between the two classes. In addition, topology information can be gained when successfully predicting a signal peptide leading a transmembrane protein since it dictates that the N terminus of the mature protein must be on the non-cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Here, we present Phobius, a combined transmembrane protein topology and signal peptide predictor. The predictor is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) that models the different sequence regions of a signal peptide and the different regions of a transmembrane protein in a series of interconnected states. Training was done on a newly assembled and curated dataset. Compared to TMHMM and SignalP, errors coming from cross-prediction between transmembrane segments and signal peptides were reduced substantially by Phobius. False classifications of signal peptides were reduced from 26.1{\%} to 3.9{\%} and false classifications of transmembrane helices were reduced from 19.0{\%} to 7.7{\%}. Phobius was applied to the proteomes of Homo sapiens and Escherichia coli. Here we also noted a drastic reduction of false classifications compared to TMHMM/SignalP, suggesting that Phobius is well suited for whole-genome annotation of signal peptides and transmembrane regions.

However, because the insertion of transmembrane helices into the membrane is the outcome of molecular interactions among protein, lipids and water, it should be possible to predict topology by methods based directly on physical data, as proposed {\textgreater}20 years ago by Kyte and Doolittle. Here, we present two simple topology-prediction methods using a recently published experimental scale of position-specific amino acid contributions to the free energy of membrane insertion that perform on a par with the current best statistics-based topology predictors. This result suggests that prediction of membrane-protein topology and structure directly from first principles is an attainable goal, given the recently improved understanding of peptide recognition by the translocon.},

Although the targeting of TA proteins to peroxisomes is dependent on PEX19, the mechanistic details of PEX19-dependent targeting and the signal that directs TA proteins to peroxisomes have remained elusive, particularly in mammals. The present study shows that PEX19 formed a complex with the peroxisomal TA protein PEX26 in the cytosol and translocated it directly to peroxisomes by interacting with the peroxisomal membrane protein PEX3. Unlike in yeast, the adenosine triphosphatase TRC40, which delivers TA proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum, was dispensable for the peroxisomal targeting of PEX26. Moreover, the basic amino acids within the luminal domain of PEX26 were essential for binding to PEX19 and thereby for peroxisomal targeting. Finally, our results suggest that a TMD that escapes capture by TRC40 and is followed by a highly basic luminal domain directs TA proteins to peroxisomes via the PEX19-dependent route.},

These proteins have a single membrane insertion sequence at their C-terminus and display a large N-terminal portion to the cytosol. Despite their importance for various cellular processes, the mechanisms by which these proteins are recognized at and inserted into their corresponding target membrane remained largely unclear. Here we address this issue and investigate the biogenesis of tail-anchored proteins residing in the mitochondrial outer membrane. To that goal we developed a highly specific assay to monitor the membrane insertion of the model tail-anchored protein Fis1. Using this assay, we show that in contrast to all other import pathways in yeast mitochondria, none of the import components at the outer membrane is involved in the insertion process of Fis1. Both the steady-state levels of Fis1 and its in vitro insertion into isolated mitochondria were unaffected when mitochondria mutated in known import factors were analyzed. Fis1 was inserted into lipid vesicles, and importantly, elevated ergosterol contents in these vesicles inhibited this insertion. Collectively, these results suggest that Fis1 is inserted into mitochondria in a novel pathway where the unique lipid composition of the mitochondrial outer membrane contributes to the selectivity of the process. Thus, this work demonstrates a novel role for lipids in the biogenesis of mitochondrial protein.},

This strategy revealed multiple conserved factors critical for endoplasmic reticulum folding, including an intimate dependence on the later secretory pathway, a previously uncharacterized six-protein transmembrane complex, and a co-chaperone complex that delivers tail-anchored proteins to their membrane insertion machinery. The use of a quantitative reporter in a comprehensive screen followed by systematic analysis of genetic dependencies should be broadly applicable to functional dissection of complex cellular processes from yeast to human.},

We show here that newly synthesised RAMP4 and Sec61beta can accumulate in a cytosolic, soluble complex with the ATPase Asna1 before insertion into ER-derived membranes. Membrane insertion of these TA proteins is stimulated by ATP, sensitive to redox conditions and blocked by alkylation of SH groups by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). By contrast, membrane insertion of cytochrome b5 is not found to be mediated by Asna1, not stimulated by ATP and not affected by NEM or an oxidative environment. The Asna1-mediated pathway of membrane insertion of RAMP4 and Sec61beta may relate to functions of these proteins in the ER stress response.},

Although these tail-anchored (TA) proteins serve numerous essential roles in cells, components of their targeting and insertion pathways have long remained elusive. Here we reveal a cytosolic TMD recognition complex (TRC) that targets TA proteins for insertion into the ER membrane. The highly conserved, 40 kDa ATPase subunit of TRC (which we termed TRC40) was identified as Asna-1. TRC40/Asna-1 interacts posttranslationally with TA proteins in a TMD-dependent manner for delivery to a proteinaceous receptor at the ER membrane. Subsequent release from TRC40/Asna-1 and insertion into the membrane depends on ATP hydrolysis. Consequently, an ATPase-deficient mutant of TRC40/Asna-1 dominantly inhibited TA protein insertion selectively without influencing other translocation pathways. Thus, TRC40/Asna-1 represents an integral component of a posttranslational pathway of membrane protein insertion whose targeting is mediated by TRC.},

Folding MPs is as useful from a practical point of view as it is thought-provoking from a theoretical one. Yet, this activity is considered as a high-risk, time-consuming endeavor, full of pitfalls, its path littered with the broken careers of graduate students sacrificed on the altar of a long shot that never paid off. In fact, a surprisingly high number of MPs have actually been folded or refolded in vitro. Analysis of the literature indicates (i) that the endeavor is not as desperate as it may seem, (ii) that techniques are diversifying and improving, and (iii) that many MPs do not need the cellular biosynthetic apparatus, nor even a membrane environment, to reach a functional 3D structure. A compilation, hopefully close to complete, is presented of MPs that have been (re)folded in vitro to-date, with the conditions of their synthesis, the denaturant(s) used, if any, and the (re)folding conditions, along with a few comments. The hope is that this analysis will encourage membrane protein biochemists to consider producing their target proteins in this way, help them decide about an experimental course, and stimulate the reflection about which environments favor membrane protein folding and why.},

In this study, we show that cotransin, a substrate-selective Sec61 inhibitor, traps nascent TMDs in the cytosolic vestibule, permitting detailed interrogation of an early pre-integration intermediate. Site-specific crosslinking revealed the pre-integrated TMD docked to Sec61 near the cytosolic tip of the lateral gate. Escape from cotransin-arrest depends not only on cotransin concentration, but also on the biophysical properties of the TMD. Genetic selection of cotransin-resistant cancer cells uncovered multiple mutations clustered near the lumenal plug of Sec61$\alpha$, thus revealing cotransin's likely site of action. Our results suggest that TMD/lateral gate interactions facilitate TMD transfer into the membrane, a process that is allosterically modulated by cotransin binding to the plug.

The voltage sensor in channel proteins consists of the highly positively charged segment, S4, and the negatively charged segments, S2 and S3. The process involved in the integration of the protein into the membrane remains to be elucidated. In this study, we used in vitro translation and translocation experiments to evaluate interactions between residues in the voltage sensor of a hyperpolarization-activated potassium channel, KAT1, and their effect on the final topology in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. A D95V mutation in S2 showed less S3-S4 integration into the membrane, whereas a D105V mutation allowed S4 to be released into the ER lumen. These results indicate that Asp(95) assists in the membrane insertion of S3-S4 and that Asp(105) helps in preventing S4 from being releasing into the ER lumen. The charge reversal mutation, R171D, in S4 rescued the D105R mutation and prevented S4 release into the ER lumen. A series of constructs containing different C-terminal truncations of S4 showed that Arg(174) was required for correct integration of S3 and S4 into the membrane. Interactions between Asp(105) and Arg(171) and between negative residues in S2 or S3 and Arg(174) may be formed transiently during membrane integration. These data clarify the role of charged residues in S2, S3, and S4 and identify posttranslational electrostatic interactions between charged residues that are required to achieve the correct voltage sensor topology in the ER membrane.},

In this study, we systematically evaluated the function of individual and combined transmembrane segments of KAT1 to direct the final topology in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by in vitro translation and translocation experiments. The assay with single-transmembrane constructs showed that S1 possesses the type II signal-anchor function, whereas S2 has the stop-transfer function. The properties fit well with the results derived from combined insertion of S1 and S2. S3 and S4 failed to integrate into the membrane by themselves. The inserted glycosylation sequence at the S3-S4 loop neither prevented the translocation of S3 and S4 nor impaired the function of voltage-dependent K(+) transport regardless of the changed length of the S3-S4 loop. S3 and S4 are likely to be posttranslationally integrated into the membrane only when somewhat specific interaction occurs between them. S5 had the ability of translocation reinitiation, and S6 had a strong preference for N(exo)/C(cyt) orientation. The pore region resided outside because of its lack of its transmembrane-spanning property. According to their own topogenic function, combined constructs of S5-P-S6 conferred the membrane-pore-membrane topology. This finding supports the notion that a set of S5-P-S6 can be independently integrated into the membrane. The results in this study provide the fundamental topogenesis mechanism of transmembrane segments involving voltage sensor and pore region in KAT1.},

Membranes are known to have modulatory effects on GPCRs via specific lipid interactions. However, the mechanisms of such modulations in cell membranes and how they influence GPCR functions remain unclear. Here we report coarse-grained MD simulations on the Adenosine A2a receptor embedded in an in vivo mimetic membrane model comprised of 10 different lipid species. Three conformational states of the receptor, i.e. the inactive state, the active state, and the active state with a mini-GS protein bound were simulated to study the impact of protein-lipid interactions on the receptor activation. The simulations revealed three specific lipids (GM3, cholesterol and PIP2) that form stable and preferential interactions with the receptor, differentiating these from bulk lipids such as PS, PE and PC. In total, nine specific lipid-binding sites were revealed. The strength of lipid interaction with these sites depends on the conformational state of the receptor, suggesting that these lipids may regulate the conformational dynamics of the receptor. In particular, we revealed a dual role of PIP2 in promoting A2aR activation, which involves stabilization of both the characteristic outward tilt of helix TM6 within receptor and also the association of A2aR and mini-Gs when the activated complex forms. Structural comparisons suggested that PIP2 may facilitate G$\alpha$ activation. Our results reveal likely allosteric effects of bound lipids in regulating the functional behaviour of GPCRs, providing a springboard for design of allosteric modulators of these biomedically important receptors.},

While it is known that GPCR activity can be altered in cancer through aberrant overexpression, gain-of-function activating mutations, and increased production and secretion of agonists, the precise mechanisms of how GPCRs contribute to cancer progression remains elusive. Protease-activated receptors (PARs) are a unique class of GPCRs implicated in cancer. PARs are a subfamily of GPCRs comprised of four members that are irreversibly activated by proteolytic cleavage induced by various proteases generated in the tumor microenvironment. Given the unusual proteolytic irreversible activation of PARs, expression of receptors at the cell surface is a key feature that influences signaling responses and is exquisitely controlled by endocytic adaptor proteins. Here, we discuss new survey data from the Cancer Genome Atlas and the Genotype-Tissue Expression projects analysis of expression of all PAR family member expression in human tumor samples as well as the role and function of the endocytic sorting machinery that controls PAR expression and signaling of PARs in normal cells and in cancer.},

Moreover, direct interaction of Hsp70 with the cochaperone Sgt2 initiates a sequential series of TA relays to the dedicated TA targeting factor Get3. In contrast to direct loading of TAs to downstream chaperones, stepwise substrate loading via Hsp70 maintains the solubility and targeting competence of TAs, ensuring their efficient delivery to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Inactivation of cytosolic Hsp70 severely impairs TA translocation in¬†vivo Our results demonstrate a new role of cytosolic Hsp70 in directly assisting the targeting of an essential class of integral membrane proteins and provide a paradigm for how "substrate funneling" through a chaperone cascade preserves the conformational quality of nascent membrane proteins during their biogenesis.},

Pex15 is normally targeted by the Get pathway to the ER, from where it travels to peroxisomes. Loss of Msp1 or loss of the Get pathway results in the redistribution of Pex15 to mitochondria. Cells lacking both a functional Get pathway and Msp1 accumulate increased amounts of Pex15 on the OMM and display severely dysfunctional mitochondrial morphology. In addition, Msp1 binds and promotes the turnover of a Pex15 mutant that is misdirected to the OMM.

To understand the molecular principles that provide the vectorial driving force of these interactions, we developed quantitative fluorescence assays to monitor Get3-effector interactions at each stage of targeting. We show that nucleotide and substrate generate differential gradients of interaction energies that drive the ordered interaction of Get3 with successive effectors. These data also provide more molecular details on how the targeting complex is captured and disassembled by the ER receptor and reveal a previously unidentified role for Get4/5 in recycling Get3 from the ER membrane at the end of the targeting reaction.

In this study, we identify additional peroxisomal TA proteins, discover more proteins that are present on multiple organelles, and reveal that a combination of TMD hydrophobicity and tail charge determines targeting to distinct organelle locations in mammals. Specifically, an increase in tail charge can override a hydrophobic TMD signal and re-direct a protein from the ER to peroxisomes or mitochondria and vice versa. We show that subtle changes in those parameters can shift TA proteins between organelles, explaining why peroxisomes and mitochondria have many of the same TA proteins.

We conclude that, although TRC40 normally plays an important role in TA protein biogenesis, it is not essential, and speculate that alternative pathways for TA protein biogenesis, including those identified in this study, contribute to the redundancy of the TRC40 pathway.},

These proteins cannot follow the SRP-dependent co-translational pathway that typifies most integral membrane proteins; instead, post-translationally, these proteins are recognized and bound by Get3 then delivered to the ER in the ATP dependent Get pathway. To elucidate a molecular mechanism for TA protein binding by Get3 we have determined three crystal structures in apo and ADP forms from Saccharomyces cerevisae (ScGet3-apo) and Aspergillus fumigatus (AfGet3-apo and AfGet3-ADP). Using structural information, we generated mutants to confirm important interfaces and essential residues.

abstract = {Tail-anchored (TA) membrane proteins are involved in a variety of important cellular functions, including membrane fusion, protein translocation, and apoptosis. The ATPase Get3 (Asna1, TRC40) was identified recently as the endoplasmic reticulum targeting factor of TA proteins. Get3 consists of an ATPase and alpha-helical subdomain enriched in methionine and glycine residues. We present structural and biochemical analyses of Get3 alone as well as in complex with a TA protein, ribosome-associated membrane protein 4 (Ramp4). The ATPase domains form an extensive dimer interface that encloses 2 nucleotides in a head-to-head orientation and a zinc ion. Amide proton exchange mass spectrometry shows that the alpha-helical subdomain of Get3 displays considerable flexibility in solution and maps the TA protein-binding site to the alpha-helical subdomain. The non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue AMPPNP-Mg(2+)- and ADP-Mg(2+)-bound crystal structures representing the pre- and posthydrolysis states are both in a closed form. In the absence of a TA protein cargo, ATP hydrolysis does not seem to be possible. Comparison with the ADP.AlF(4)(-)-bound structure representing the transition state (Mateja A, et al. (2009) Nature 461:361-366) indicates how the presence of a TA protein is communicated to the ATP-binding site. In vitro membrane insertion studies show that recombinant Get3 inserts Ramp4 in a nucleotide- and receptor-dependent manner. Although ATP hydrolysis is not required for Ramp4 insertion per se, it seems to be required for efficient insertion. We postulate that ATP hydrolysis is needed to release Get3 from its receptor. Taken together, our results provide mechanistic insights into posttranslational targeting of TA membrane proteins by Get3.},

The post-translational insertion of the yeast TA proteins into the ER membrane requires the Golgi ER trafficking (GET) complex which contains Get1, Get2 and Get3. Get3 is an ATPase that recognizes and binds the C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) of the TA proteins. We have determined the crystal structures of Get3 from two yeast species, S. cerevisiae and D. hansenii, respectively. These high resolution crystal structures show that Get3 contains a nucleotide-binding domain and a ‚Äúfinger‚Äù domain for binding the TA protein TMD. A large hydrophobic groove on the finger domain of S. cerevisiae Get3 structure might represent the binding site for TMD of TA proteins. A hydrophobic helix from a symmetry-related Get3 molecule sits in the TMD-binding groove and mimics the TA binding scenario. Interestingly, the crystal structures of the Get3 dimers from S. cerevisiae and D. hansenii exhibit distinct conformations. The S. cerevisiae Get3 dimer structure does not contain nucleotides and maintains an ‚Äúopen‚Äù conformation, while the D. hansenii Get3 dimer structure binds ADP and stays in a ‚Äúclosed‚Äù conformation. We propose that the conformational changes to switch the Get3 between the open and closed conformations may facilitate the membrane insertions for TA proteins.},

Here we show that Get3, the yeast homolog of the TA-interacting factor Asna1/Trc40, specifically recognizes TMDs of TA proteins destined for the secretory pathway. Get3 recognition represents a key decision step, whose loss can lead to misinsertion of TA proteins into mitochondria. Get3-TA protein complexes are recruited for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane insertion by the Get1/Get2 receptor. In vivo, the absence of Get1/Get2 leads to cytosolic aggregation of Get3-TA complexes and broad defects in TA protein biogenesis. In¬†vitro reconstitution demonstrates that the Get proteins directly mediate insertion of newly synthesized TA proteins into ER membranes. Thus, the GET complex represents a critical mechanism for ensuring efficient and accurate targeting of TA proteins.},

abstract = {Tail-anchored (TA) protein synthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) represents a distinct and novel process that provides a paradigm for understanding post-translational membrane insertion in eukaryotes. The major route for delivering TA proteins to the ER requires both ATP and one or more cytosolic factors that facilitate efficient membrane insertion. Until recently, the identity of these cytosolic components was elusive, but two candidates have now been suggested to promote ATP-dependent TA protein integration. The first is the cytosolic chaperone complex of Hsp40/Hsc70, and the second is a novel ATPase denoted Asna-1 or TRC40. In this study we focus on the role of the Hsp40/Hsc70 complex in promoting TA protein biogenesis at the ER. We show that the membrane integration of most TA proteins is stimulated by Hsp40/Hsc70 when using purified components and a reconstituted system. In contrast, when both Hsp40/Hsc70 and Asna-1/TRC40 are provided as a complete system, small molecule inhibition of Hsp40/Hsc70 indicates that only a subset of TA proteins are obligatory clients for this chaperone-mediated delivery route. We show that the hydrophobicity of the TA region dictates whether a precursor is delivered to the ER via the Hsp40/Hsc70 or Asna-1/TRC40-dependent route, and we conclude that these distinct cytosolic ATPases are responsible for two different ATP-dependent pathways of TA protein biogenesis.},

Hsp40s stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp70s and target unfolded proteins to Hsp70s. Genetic and biochemical evidence supports a role for cytosolic Hsp70s and Hsp40s in the post-translational translocation of precursor proteins into endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. To gain mechanistic insight, we measured the effects of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ssa1p (Hsp70) and Ydj1p (Hsp40) on the translocation of histidine-tagged prepro-alpha-factor (ppalphaF6H) into microsomes. Radiolabeled ppalphaF6H was affinity purified from wheat germ translation reactions (or Escherichia coli) to remove endogenous chaperones. We demonstrated that either Ssa1p or Ydj1p stimulates post-translational translocation by preventing ppalphaF6H aggregation. The binding and/or hydrolysis of ATP by Ssa1p were required to maintain the translocation competence of ppalphaF6H. To clarify the contributions of membrane-bound and cytosolic Ydj1p, we compared the efficiency of chaperone-dependent translocation into wild-type and Ydj1p-deficient microsomes. Neither soluble nor membrane-bound Ydj1p was essential for post-translational protein translocation. The ability of Ssa1p, Ydj1p, or both chaperones to restore the translocation competence of aggregated ppalphaF6H was negligible.},

Here we have used the yeast system to study translocation of the C terminus of a tagged form of mammalian cytochrome b(5), carrying an N-glycosylation site in its C-terminal domain (b(5)-Nglyc). Utilization of this site was adopted as a rigorous criterion for translocation across the ER membrane of yeast wild-type and mutant cells. The C terminus of b(5)-Nglyc was rapidly glycosylated in mutants where Sec61p was defective and incapable of translocating carboxypeptidase Y, a well known substrate for post-translational translocation. Likewise, inactivation of several other components of the translocon machinery had no effect on b(5)-Nglyc translocation. The kinetics of translocation were faster for b(5)-Nglyc than for a signal peptide-containing reporter. Depletion of the cellular ATP pool to a level that retarded Sec61p-dependent post-translational translocation still allowed translocation of b(5)-Nglyc. Similarly, only low ATP concentrations (below 1 microm), in addition to cytosolic protein(s), were required for in vitro translocation of b(5)-Nglyc into mammalian microsomes. Thus, translocation of tail-anchored b(5)-Nglyc proceeds by a mechanism different from that of signal peptide-driven post-translational translocation.},

We have used a cross-linking approach to identify ER components that may be involved in the membrane insertion of tail-anchored proteins. We find that several newly synthesized tail-anchored proteins are transiently associated with a defined subset of cellular components. Among these, we identify several ER proteins, including subunits of the Sec61 translocon, Sec62p, Sec63p, and the 25-kDa subunit of the signal peptidase complex. When we analyze the cotranslational membrane insertion of a comparable signal-anchored protein we find the nascent polypeptide associated with a similar set of ER components. We conclude that the pathways for the integration of tail-anchored and signal-anchored membrane proteins at the ER exhibit a substantial degree of overlap, and we propose that this reflects similarities between co- and post-translational membrane insertion.},

For example, mammalian TRC40 has a well-defined role during delivery of tail-anchored proteins to the ER. Although its Saccharomyces cerevisiae equivalent, Get3, is known to function in concert with at least four other components, Get1, Get2, Get4 and Get5 (Mdy2), the role of additional mammalian proteins during tail-anchored protein biogenesis is unclear. To this end, we analysed the cytosolic binding partners of Sec61beta, a well-defined substrate of TRC40, and identified Bat3 as a previously unknown interacting partner. Depletion of Bat3 inhibits the membrane integration of Sec61beta, but not of a second, TRC40-independent, tail-anchored protein, cytochrome b5. Thus, Bat3 influences the in vitro membrane integration of tail-anchored proteins using the TRC40 pathway. When expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking a functional GET pathway for tail-anchored protein biogenesis, Bat3 associates with the resulting cytosolic pool of non-targeted chains and diverts it to the nucleus.

abstract = {Signal recognition particle (SRP) plays a central role in the delivery of classical secretory and membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). All nascent chains studied to date dissociate from SRP once released from the ribosome, thereby supporting a strictly cotranslational mode of action for eukaryotic SRP. We now report a novel post-translational function for SRP in the targeting of tail-anchored (TA) proteins to the ER. TA proteins possess a hydrophobic membrane insertion sequence at their C-terminus such that it can only emerge from the ribosome after translation is terminated. We show that SRP can associate post-translationally with this type of ER-targeting signal, and deliver newly synthesised TA proteins to the ER membrane by a pathway dependent upon GTP and the SRP receptor. We find that dependency upon this SRP-dependent route is precursor specific, and propose a unifying model to describe the biogenesis of TA proteins in vivo.},

abstract = {We have developed an assay in which incomplete preprolactin chains of varying lengths are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane in an elongation independent manner. The reaction had the same molecular requirements as nascent chain translocation across the ER membrane, namely, it was signal recognition particle (SRP) dependent, and required the nascent chain to be present as peptidyl tRNA (i.e. most likely ribosome associated) and to have its signal sequence exposed outside the ribosome. We found that the efficiency of the targeting reaction dropped dramatically as the chains grew longer than 140 amino acids in length, which probably reflected a decrease in affinity of the nascent chain-ribosome complex for SRP. Thus at physiological SRP concentrations (10 nM) there appears a sharp cut-off point in the ability of these chains to be targeted, while at high SRP concentrations (270 nM) all chains could be targeted. In kinetic experiments, high concentrations of SRP were found to change the time in elongation after which translocation of the nascent polypeptide could no longer occur.},

Three different mechanisms, each requiring a different set of channel binding partners, are employed to move polypeptide substrates: The ribosome feeds the polypeptide chain directly into the channel, a ratcheting mechanism is used by the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP, and a pushing mechanism is utilized by the bacterial ATPase SecA.

Here, we reveal the composition of¬†a conserved multiprotein TMD recognition complex (TRC) and show that distinct TRC subunits recognize the two types of TMD signals. By engineering mutations in a mitochondrial TMD, we switch over its TRC subunit recognition, thus leading to its misinsertion into the ER. Biochemical reconstitution with purified components demonstrates that TRC tethers and enzymatically activates Get3 to selectively hand off ER-bound TA proteins to Get3. Thus, ER-bound TA proteins are sorted at the top of a TMD chaperone cascade that culminates with the formation of Get3-TA protein complexes, which are recruited to the ER membrane for insertion.},

These proteins must be efficiently captured and delivered to the target membrane, and indeed a failure to do so may even disrupt proteostasis resulting in cellular dysfunction and disease.

abstract = {Although transmembrane proteins generally require membrane-embedded machinery for integration, a few can insert spontaneously into liposomes. Previously, we established that the tail-anchored (TA) protein cytochrome b(5) (b5) can posttranslationally translocate 28 residues downstream to its transmembrane domain (TMD) across protein-free bilayers (Brambillasca, S., M. Yabal, P. Soffientini, S. Stefanovic, M. Makarow, R.S. Hegde, and N. Borgese. 2005. EMBO J. 24:2533-2542). In the present study, we investigated the limits of this unassisted translocation and report that surprisingly long (85 residues) domains of different sequence and charge placed downstream of b5's TMD can posttranslationally translocate into mammalian microsomes and liposomes at nanomolar nucleotide concentrations. Furthermore, integration of these constructs occurred in vivo in translocon-defective yeast strains. Unassisted translocation was not unique to b5 but was also observed for another TA protein (protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B) whose TMD, like the one of b5, is only moderately hydrophobic. In contrast, more hydrophobic TMDs, like synaptobrevin's, were incapable of supporting unassisted integration, possibly because of their tendency to aggregate in aqueous solution. Our data resolve long-standing discrepancies on TA protein insertion and are relevant to membrane evolution, biogenesis, and physiology.},

We reconstituted the core reactions for membrane targeting and ubiquitination of nascent tail-anchored membrane proteins to understand how their fate is determined. The central six-component triage system is divided into an uncommitted client-SGTA complex, a self-sufficient targeting module, and an embedded but self-sufficient quality control module. Client-SGTA engagement of the targeting module induces rapid, private, and committed client transfer to TRC40 for successful biosynthesis. Commitment to ubiquitination is dictated primarily by comparatively slower client dissociation from SGTA and nonprivate capture by the BAG6 subunit of the quality control module. Our results provide a paradigm for how priority and time are encoded within a multichaperone triage system.},

@article{Guna2018,
abstract = {One-fourth of eukaryotic genes code for integral membrane proteins, nearly all of which are inserted and assembled at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The defining feature of membrane proteins is one or more transmembrane domains (TMDs). During membrane protein biogenesis, TMDs are selectively recognized, shielded, and chaperoned into the lipid bilayer, where they often assemble with other TMDs. If maturation fails, exposed TMDs serve as a cue for engagement of degradation pathways. Thus, TMD-recognition factors in the cytosol and ER are essential for membrane protein biogenesis and quality control. Here, we discuss the growing assortment of cytosolic and membrane-embedded TMD-recognition factors, the pathways within which they operate, and mechanistic principles of recognition. Introduction Integral membrane proteins are an extremely diverse class of proteins that represent 20‚Äì30{\%} of the protein-coding genes of all organisms [1]. They are essential for cellular function, with crit-ical roles in signal transduction, organelle biogenesis, intracel-lular trafficking, small molecule transport, and cell adhesion. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the site of initial assembly for nearly all membrane proteins in eukaryotes [2]. Structurally, the defining feature of an integral membrane protein is one or more transmembrane domains (TMDs), which are typically stretches of predominantly hydrophobic amino acids that span the lipid bilayer as alpha helices [3]. The integration of TMDs into the membrane, the decisive event in the biogenesis of all membrane proteins, poses two major biophysical challenges that must be overcome by the targeting and insertion machinery. First, the protein synthesis machinery resides in the cytosol, so membrane proteins are initially made in an aqueous environment where they are intrinsically insoluble. This means that before a membrane protein can be stably inserted into the lipid bilayer, it must necessarily transit through an inhospitable medium. Thus, specialized factors are needed to recognize and shield TMDs in the cytosol until they can engage with the insertion ma-chinery at the destination membrane [4,5]. Without such factors, TMDs are prone to potentially toxic aggregation and inappro-priate interactions. Second, TMDs vary widely in their sequence and biophysical properties [6], making their recognition in the cytosol and at the membrane challenging. TMDs are typically 12‚Äì35 residues long, share no unifying sequence features, and vary widely in hy-drophobicity, helical propensity, and context within a protein. Hydrophobicity analysis shows appreciable overlap between bona fide TMDs and hydrophobic segments of soluble proteins [7]. Yet, the biosynthetic machinery in the cytosol and membrane must make this distinction with high fidelity. Ultimately, TMD recognition is the critical and decisive step made by the mem-brane-embedded machinery which partitions them from an aqueous to lipid environment [2,8]. These two central challenges, effective chaperoning and high-fidelity recognition, highlight the essential functions played by TMD-recognition factors throughout the biosynthetic process. Cytosolic factors all share the unifying function of shielding their TMD clients from solvent. In addition, these factors are often coupled, usually via protein‚Äìprotein interactions, to either recep-tors at the ER for targeting, or ubiquitination machinery for degradation. TMD-recognition factors at the membrane typically provide a conduit between the cytosol and the interior of the lipid bilayer to facilitate either insertion or dislocation. These factors must display selectivity, with access between the cytosol and membrane usually being gated. In this review, we discuss the functions and mechanisms of action of TMD-recognition factors. While some of these have a distinct role within a single dedicated pathway, others are increasingly appreciated to be 'generalists' that interface with multiple biological processes. For this reason, we have not or-ganised the article around individual targeting, insertion, and quality control pathways. Instead, the article is segregated by factors that act in the cytosol and those that act in the mem-brane. In both sections, we seek to highlight shared principles of TMD handling between otherwise unrelated factors.},

abstract = {The canonical protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B is an important regulator of diverse cellular signaling networks. PTP1B has long been thought to exert its influence solely from its perch on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER); however, an additional subpopulation of PTP1B has recently been detected in mitochondria extracted from rat brain tissue. Here, we show that PTP1B's mitochondrial localization is general (observed across diverse mammalian cell lines) and sensitively dependent on the transmembrane domain length, C-terminal charge and hydropathy of its short (‚â§35 amino acid) tail anchor. Our electron microscopy of specific DAB precipitation revealed that PTP1B localizes via its tail anchor to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy establishing that this OMM pool contributes to the previously reported cytoplasmic interaction of PTP1B with endocytosed epidermal growth factor receptor. We additionally examined the mechanism of PTP1B's insertion into the ER membrane through heterologous expression of PTP1B's tail anchor in wild-type yeast and yeast mutants of major conserved ER insertion pathways: In none of these yeast strains was ER targeting significantly impeded, providing in vivo support for the hypothesis of spontaneous membrane insertion (as previously demonstrated in vitro). Further functional elucidation of the newly recognized mitochondrial pool of PTP1B will likely be important for understanding its complex roles in cellular responses to external stimuli, cell proliferation and diseased states.},

abstract = {While interactions of single-span transmembrane helices have been studied to a significant extent in the past years, the folding of polytopic $\alpha$-helical transmembrane proteins, as well as their oligomerization, are far less analyzed and understood. The goal of the few thus far performed thermodynamic studies, in which unfolding of polytopic TM proteins was described, was to achieve a mild, potentially reversible unfolding process, to finally derive thermodynamic parameters for the reverse folding pathway. In the first part of this review, we summarize the studies analyzing the thermodynamic stability and folding pathways of polytopic transmembrane proteins. Based on these studies, we deduce some common principles, guiding transmembrane protein unfolding and folding, important for the design of future folding/unfolding studies. Furthermore, the discussed observations can conceptually guide an experimental search for proper in vitro transmembrane protein refolding conditions. In many of the resolved membrane protein structures, individual monomers interact to form higher ordered oligomers. In most cases, oligomerization of those monomeric units appears to be intimately linked to the protein function, and folding of the individual protomers might even occur only after interaction. In the second part of this review, we discuss folding pathways of oligomeric $\alpha$-helical transmembrane proteins as well as causes and consequences of $\alpha$-helical transmembrane protein oligomerization.},

The significance of electrostatics in the tunnel remains relatively uninvestigated, yet they are likely to play a role in translation and secondary folding of nascent peptides. To probe the role of nascent peptide charges in ribosome function, we used a molecular tape measure that was engineered to contain different numbers of charged amino acids localized to known regions of the tunnel and measured chain elongation rates. Positively charged arginine or lysine sequences produce transient arrest (pausing) before the nascent peptide is fully elongated. The rate of conversion from transiently arrested to full-length nascent peptide is faster for peptides containing neutral or negatively charged residues than for those containing positively charged residues. We provide experimental evidence that extraribosomal mechanisms do not account for this charge-specific pausing. We conclude that pausing is due to charge-specific interactions between the tunnel and the nascent peptide. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Tail-anchored (TA) protein synthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) represents a distinct and novel process that provides a paradigm for understanding post-translational membrane insertion in eukaryotes. The major route for delivering TA proteins to the ER requires both ATP and one or more cytosolic factors that facilitate efficient membrane insertion. Until recently, the identity of these cytosolic components was elusive, but two candidates have now been suggested to promote ATP-dependent TA protein integration. The first is the cytosolic chaperone complex of Hsp40/Hsc70, and the second is a novel ATPase denoted Asna-1 or TRC40. In this study we focus on the role of the Hsp40/Hsc70 complex in promoting TA protein biogenesis at the ER. We show that the membrane integration of most TA proteins is stimulated by Hsp40/Hsc70 when using purified components and a reconstituted system. In contrast, when both Hsp40/Hsc70 and Asna-1/TRC40 are provided as a complete system, small molecule inhibition of Hsp40/Hsc70 indicates that only a subset of TA proteins are obligatory clients for this chaperone-mediated delivery route. We show that the hydrophobicity of the TA region dictates whether a precursor is delivered to the ER via the Hsp40/Hsc70 or Asna-1/TRC40-dependent route, and we conclude that these distinct cytosolic ATPases are responsible for two different ATP-dependent pathways of TA protein biogenesis.},

abstract = {Tail-anchored (TA) proteins are membrane proteins that contain an N-terminal domain exposed to the cytosol and a single transmembrane segment near the C-terminus followed by few or no polar residues. TA proteins with a mildly hydrophobic transmembrane domain, such as cytochrome b5 (b5), are able to insert post-translationally into pure lipid vesicles without assistance from membrane proteins. Here, we investigated whether any cytosolic proteins are needed to maintain b5 in a competent state for transmembrane integration. Using b5 constructs translated in vitro or produced in bacteria, we demonstrate that cytosolic proteins are neither necessary nor facilitatory for the unassisted translocation of b5. Furthermore, we demonstrate that no cytosolic protein is involved in the translocation of a C-terminal domain of 85 residues appended to the transmembrane domain of b5. Nevertheless, b5 does bind cytosolic proteins, and in their presence but not in their absence, its insertion into liposomes is inhibited by the thiol oxidant diamide and the alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide. The effect of diamide is also observed in living cells. Thus, the specific in vivo targeting of b5 might be achieved by interaction with redox-sensitive targeting factors that hinder its nonspecific insertion into any permissive bilayer.},

abstract = {Liposomes can be used as drug delivery vehicles and like other nanoparticles, it offers a beneficial distribution mechanism for in vivo therapeutics. Although therapeutic liposomes reach tissues through entirely passive means it is possible to increase liposome uptake by a specific target cell type. Cell specificity in liposomal drug delivery can be achieved by displaying receptor specific targeting peptides on the liposome surface. These ligands evoke endocytic uptake of the liposome upon binding their cognate cell surface receptor and the liposome cargo is subsequently delivered to an intracellular compartment. The methodology used to attach such targeting peptides to liposomes is currently limited by the chemistry of conjugation reactions with functional groups that are attached to the lipid constituents. This project set out to explore an alternative method of ligand attachment using novel chimeric tail-anchored (TA) proteins. Several studies suggest that the transmembrane domain of the TA protein cytochrome b5 is capable of spontaneous insertion into synthetic membranes. Hence, artificial protein chimeras containing the transmembrane domain from cytochrome b5 were created and I showed that these polypeptides provided a robust membrane tether for the incorporation of three different targeting moieties into preformed liposomes. These TA protein chimeras were used to investigate their effect on liposome uptake using two cell culture models. When liposomes loaded with a model fluorescent cargo were modified with the chimeric polypeptides, one of the targeting ligands chosen for study significantly enhanced the association of the liposomes with both cell types. Furthermore, in the case of HeLa M cells I was also able to show that the liposome cargo was successfully internalised. However, when the liposomes were loaded with the cytotoxic drug doxorubicin, the effects of the ligands, as judged on the basis of cell viability and caspase activation, were comparatively modest. I speculate about the likely basis for these findings and discuss whether the attachment of targeting ligands to liposomes through tail- anchoring could play a role in the design of future drug delivery systems.},

It is well established that proteins can fold cotranslationally outside the ribosome exit tunnel, whereas studies of folding inside the exit tunnel have so far detected only the formation of helical secondary structure and collapsed or partially structured folding intermediates. Here, using a combination of cotranslational nascent chain force measurements, inter-subunit fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies on single translating ribosomes, molecular dynamics simulations, and cryoelectron microscopy, we show that a small zinc-finger domain protein can fold deep inside the vestibule of the ribosome exit tunnel. Thus, for small protein domains, the ribosome itself can provide the kind of sheltered folding environment that chaperones provide for larger proteins. Nilsson et al. present an integrated approach to the study of cotranslational protein folding, in which the folding transition is mapped by arrest-peptide-mediated force measurements, molecular dynamics simulations, and cryo-EM (electron microscopy). The small zinc-finger domain ADR1a is shown to fold deep inside the ribosome exit tunnel.},

abstract = {Many endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins maintain their residence by dynamic retrieval from downstream compartments of the secretory pathway. In previous work we compared the retrieval process mediated by the two signals, KKMP and KDEL, by appending them to the same neutral reporter protein, CD8, and found that the two signals determine a different steady-state localization of the reporter. CD8-K (the KDEL-bearing form) was restricted mainly to the ER, whereas CD8-E19 (the KKMP-bearing form) was distributed also to the intermediate compartment and Golgi complex. To investigate whether this different steady-state distribution reflects a difference in exit rates from the ER and/or in retrieval, we have now followed the first steps of export of the two constructs from the ER and their trafficking between ER and Golgi complex. Contrary to expectation, we find that CD8-K is efficiently recruited into transport vesicles, whereas CD8-E19 is not. Thus, the more restricted ER localization of CD8-K must be explained by a more efficient retrieval to the ER. Moreover, because most of ER resident CD8-K is not O-glycosylated but almost all CD8-E19 is, the results suggest that CD8-K is retrieved from the intermediate compartment, before reaching the Golgi, where O-glycosylation begins. These results illustrate how different retrieval signals determine different trafficking patterns and pose novel questions on the underlying molecular mechanisms.},

@article{Remm2000,
abstract = {The complete genome sequence of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans provides an excellent basis for studying the distribution and evolution of protein families in higher eukaryotes. Three fundamental questions are as follows: How many paralog clusters exist in one species, how many of these are shared with other species, and how many proteins can be assigned a functional counterpart in other species? We have addressed these questions in a detailed study of predicted membrane proteins in C. elegans and their mammalian homologs. All worm proteins predicted to contain at least two transmembrane segments were clustered on the basis of sequence similarity. This resulted in 189 groups with two or more sequences, containing, in total, 2647 worm proteins. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) were created for each family, and were used to retrieve mammalian homologs from the SWISSPROT, TREMBL, and VTS databases. About one-half of these clusters had mammalian homologs. Putative worm-mammalian orthologs were extracted by use of nine different phylogenetic methods and BLAST. Eight clusters initially thought to be worm-specific were assigned mammalian homologs after searching EST and genomic sequences. A compilation of 174 orthology assignments made with high confidence is presented. [Tables describing transmembrane protein families and orthology assignments are available from ftp.cgr.ki.se/pub/data/worm.] The first multicellular organism with a completely se-quenced genome is the roundworm Caenorhabditis el-egans (Consortium 1998). The genome comprises ‚àº100 million basepairs, and is predicted to encode ‚àº19,000 proteins. Previous analysis has revealed that approxi-mately two-thirds of the proteins can be assigned a tentative biochemical function on the basis of se-quence homology to proteins of known function. A majority of the proteins have homologs within the worm genome (paralogs). The fraction of proteins with a detectable paralog has been estimated by two differ-ent methods to within 66{\%} and 95{\%} (Sonnhammer and Durbin 1997; Teichmann and Chothia 2000). It was also noted that a large fraction of the paralog clus-ters do not match proteins in other species. Sonnham-mer and Durbin (1997) presented a dozen of the largest such cases and showed that some clusters could be as-signed a tentative function by use of hidden Markov models (HMMs). Multiple alignment-based homology search methods such as HMMs and profiles are consid-ered more sensitive than single-sequence methods (Eddy 1996, 1998; Park et al. 1998). Examples of HMM-based protein family databases are Pfam (Bateman et al. 2000) and SMART (Schultz et al. 2000). Our aim was to classify all membrane proteins in C. elegans by grouping them in clusters of paralogs, and annotating them according to sequence homology to proteins with a known function and orthology to mammalian proteins. The membrane proteins are at-tractive for several reasons. They form a rather well-defined group of an easily predicted class of proteins. Membrane proteins contain many interesting recep-tors and signaling proteins that are particularly impor-tant in multicellular organisms and cannot be studied in bacteria or in yeast. Membrane proteins are also challenging for many sequence comparison programs because of high degeneracy in hydrophobic membrane domains. Because of their special environment, mem-brane proteins, overall, are thought to be less con-strained in sequence than water-soluble domains, and therefore evolve more rapidly. Our main interest was concentrated on the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family (Kolakowski 1994; Horn et al. 1998). GPCRs are represented in the Pfam database by five different families. These models and/or simple pairwise comparisons are often used to discover novel GPCR genes (Bargmann 1998; Robert-son 1998, 2000). However, the use of only models of well-established families reduces the chance of finding any new genes that could have the same function, but lack obvious sequence similarity. Alternative methods, not dependent on sequence similarity to known GPCRs could be useful to discover distinct novel fami-lies. For example, several new GPCR sequences have been found from Drosophila genome by modeling the pattern of their transmembrane domains (Clyne et al. 1999). We use a similar approach to find and charac-terize membrane proteins from C. elegans. Briefly, we},

We present here a new tool for discovery of such unstructured, or disordered regions within proteins. GlobPlot (http://globplot.embl.de) is a web service that allows the user to plot the tendency within the query protein for order/globularity and disorder. We show examples with known proteins where it successfully identifies inter-domain segments containing linear motifs, and also apparently ordered regions that do not contain any recognised domain. GlobPlot may be useful in domain hunting efforts. The plots indicate that instances of known domains may often contain additional N- or C-terminal segments that appear ordered. Thus GlobPlot may be of use in the design of constructs corresponding to globular proteins, as needed for many biochemical studies, particularly structural biology. GlobPlot has a pipeline interface--GlobPipe--for the advanced user to do whole proteome analysis.

abstract = {Membrane protein folding and topogenesis are tuned to a given lipid profile since lipids and proteins have co-evolved to follow a set of interdependent rules governing final protein topological organization. Transmembrane domain (TMD) topology is determined via a dynamic process in which topogenic signals in the nascent protein are recognized and interpreted initially by the translocon followed by a given lipid profile in accordance with the Positive Inside Rule. The net zero charged phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine and other neutral lipids dampen the translocation potential of negatively charged residues in favor of the cytoplasmic retention potential of positively charged residues (Charge Balance Rule). This explains why positively charged residues are more potent topological signals than negatively charged residues. Dynamic changes in orientation of TMDs during or after membrane insertion are attributed to non-sequential cooperative and collective lipid‚Äìprotein charge interactions as well as long-term interactions within a protein. The proportion of dual topological conformers of a membrane protein varies in a dose responsive manner with changes in the membrane lipid composition not only in vivo but also in vitro and therefore is determined by the membrane lipid composition. Switching between two opposite TMD topologies can occur in either direction in vivo and also in liposomes (designated as fliposomes) independent of any other cellular factors. Such lipid-dependent post-insertional reversibility of TMD orientation indicates a thermodynamically driven process that can occur at any time and in any cell membrane driven by changes in the lipid composition. This dynamic view of protein topological organization influenced by the lipid environment reveals previously unrecognized possibilities for cellular regulation and understanding of disease states resulting from mis-folded proteins.

abstract = {Tail-anchored (TA) protein synthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) represents a distinct and novel process that provides a paradigm for understanding post-translational membrane insertion in eukaryotes. The major route for delivering TA proteins to the ER requires both ATP and one or more cytosolic factors that facilitate efficient membrane insertion. Until recently, the identity of these cytosolic components was elusive, but two candidates have now been suggested to promote ATP-dependent TA protein integration. The first is the cytosolic chaperone complex of Hsp40/Hsc70, and the second is a novel ATPase denoted Asna-1 or TRC40. In this study we focus on the role of the Hsp40/Hsc70 complex in promoting TA protein biogenesis at the ER. We show that the membrane integration of most TA proteins is stimulated by Hsp40/Hsc70 when using purified components and a reconstituted system. In contrast, when both Hsp40/Hsc70 and Asna-1/TRC40 are provided as a complete system, small molecule inhibition of Hsp40/Hsc70 indicates that only a subset of TA proteins are obligatory clients for this chaperone-mediated delivery route. We show that the hydrophobicity of the TA region dictates whether a precursor is delivered to the ER via the Hsp40/Hsc70 or Asna-1/TRC40-dependent route, and we conclude that these distinct cytosolic ATPases are responsible for two different ATP-dependent pathways of TA protein biogenesis.},

abstract = {Tail-anchored proteins are a distinct class of integral membrane proteins located in several eukaryotic organelles, where they perform a diverse range of functions. These proteins have in common the C-terminal location of their transmembrane anchor and the resulting post-translational nature of their membrane insertion, which, unlike the co-translational membrane insertion of most other proteins, is not coupled to ongoing protein synthesis. The study of tail-anchored proteins has provided a paradigm for understanding the components and pathways that mediate post-translational biogenesis of membrane proteins at the endoplasmic reticulum. In this Commentary, we review recent studies that have converged at a consensus regarding the molecular mechanisms that underlie this process--namely, that multiple pathways underlie the biogenesis of tail-anchored proteins at the endoplasmic reticulum.},

abstract = {Proteins destined for the endomembrane system of eukaryotic cells are typically translocated into or across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and this process is normally closely coupled to protein synthesis. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that a significant proportion of proteins are targeted to and inserted into the ER membrane post-translationally, that is after their synthesis is complete. These proteins must be efficiently captured and delivered to the target membrane, and indeed a failure to do so may even disrupt proteostasis resulting in cellular dysfunction and disease. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms by which various protein precursors can be targeted to the ER and either inserted into or translocated across the membrane post-translationally.

The critical element in the sensor domains in virtually all voltagegated ion channels is the S4 helix, which contains four or more regularly spaced Arg residues interspersed with hydrophobic residues. Voltage activation has been suggested to involve paddles, each composed of a mildly hydrophobic S3 helix packed against a highly charged S4 helix, that move through the lipid bilayer in response to membrane depolarization (2). This controversial mechanism of gating is at odds with models that envisage the S4 segment as isolated from the lipid bilayer in canaliculi within the channel protein. At the heart of the controversy is the idea that the paddle model is implausible, because of the energetic cost of burying charges in a lipid bilayer (3).},

Here we show that the Guided Entry of Tail-anchored protein (GET) pathway selects TA proteins destined to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) utilizing distinct molecular steps, including differential binding by the co-chaperone Sgt2 and kinetic proofreading after ATP hydrolysis by the targeting factor Get3. Further, the different steps select for distinct physicochemical features of the TA substrate.

Although the interaction between the bacterial SecYEG translocon and YidC has been observed in multiple studies, it is still unknown which domains of YidC are in contact with the SecYEG translocon. By in vivo and in vitro site-directed and para-formaldehyde cross-linking we identified the auxiliary transmembrane domain 1 of E. coli YidC as a major contact site for SecY and SecG. Additional SecY contacts were observed for the tightly packed globular domain and the C1 loop of YidC, which reveals that the hydrophilic cavity of YidC faces the lateral gate of SecY. Surprisingly, YidC-SecYEG contacts were only observed when YidC and SecYEG were present at about stoichiometric concentrations, suggesting that the YidC-SecYEG contact in vivo is either very transient or only observed for a very small SecYEG sub-population. This is different for the YidC-SRP and YidC-FtsY interaction, which involves the C1 loop of YidC and is efficiently observed even at sub-stoichiometric concentrations of SRP/FtsY. In summary, our data provide a first detailed view on how YidC interacts with the SecYEG translocon and the SRP-targeting machinery.},

abstract = {The lacY gene of Escherichia coli was cut into two approximately equal-size fragments with Afl II and subcloned individually or together under separate lac operator/promoters in plasmid pT7-5. Under these conditions, lac permease is expressed in two portions: (i) the N-terminal portion (the N terminus, the first six putative transmembrane helices, and most of putative loop 7) and (ii) the C-terminal portion (the last six putative transmembrane helices and the C terminus). Cells harboring pT7-5 encoding both fragments transport lactose at about 30{\%} the rate of cells expressing intact permease to a comparable steady-state level of accumulation. In contrast, cells expressing either half of the permease independently do not transport lactose. As judged by [35S]methionine labeling and immunoblotting, intact permease is completely absent from the membrane of cells expressing lacY fragments either individually or together. Thus, transport activity must result from an association between independently synthesized pieces of lac permease. When the gene fragments are expressed individually, the N-terminal portion of the permease is observed inconsistently, and the C-terminal portion is not observed. When the gene fragments are expressed together, polypeptides identified as the N- and C-terminal moieties of the permease are found in the membrane. It is concluded that the N- or C-terminal halves of lac permease are proteolyzed when synthesized independently and that association between the two complementing polypeptides leads to a more stable, catalytically active complex.},

abstract = {Membrane-embedded voltage-sensor domains in voltage-dependent potassium channels (K(v) channels) contain an impressive number of charged residues. How can such highly charged protein domains be efficiently inserted into biological membranes? In the plant K(v) channel KAT1, the S2, S3, and S4 transmembrane helices insert cooperatively, because the S3, S4, and S3-S4 segments do not have any membrane insertion ability by themselves. Here we show that, in the Drosophila Shaker K(v) channel, which has a more hydrophobic S3 helix than KAT1, S3 can both insert into the membrane by itself and mediate the insertion of the S3-S4 segment in the absence of S2. An engineered KAT1 S3-S4 segment in which the hydrophobicity of S3 was increased or where S3 was replaced by Shaker S3 behaves as Shaker S3-S4. Electrostatic interactions among charged residues in S2, S3, and S4, including the salt bridges between E283 or E293 in S2 and R368 in S4, are required for fully efficient membrane insertion of the Shaker voltage-sensor domain. These results suggest that cooperative insertion of the voltage-sensor transmembrane helices is a property common to K(v) channels and that the degree of cooperativity depends on a balance between electrostatic and hydrophobic forces.},

The enzyme activity from the alkaline phosphatase and beta-galactosidase fusion plasmid showed that the widely predicted S1, S2, S5, and S6 segments were inserted into the membrane. Although the S3 segment in the alkaline phosphatase fusion protein could not function as an export signal, the replacement of a negatively charged residue inside S3 with a neutral amino acid resulted in an increase in alkaline phosphatase activity, which indicates that the alkaline phosphatase was translocated into the periplasm. For membrane translocation of S3, the neutralization of a negatively charged residue in S3 may be required presumably because of pairing with a positively charged residue of S4. These results revealed that KAT1 has the common six transmembrane-spanning membrane topology that has been predicted for the Shaker superfamily of voltage-dependent K+ channels.

abstract = {The lacY gene of Escherichia coli was cut into two approximately equal-size fragments with Afl II and subcloned individually or together under separate lac operator/promoters in plasmid pT7-5. Under these conditions, lac permease is expressed in two portions: (i) the N-terminal portion (the N terminus, the first six putative transmembrane helices, and most of putative loop 7) and (ii) the C-terminal portion (the last six putative transmembrane helices and the C terminus). Cells harboring pT7-5 encoding both fragments transport lactose at about 30{\%} the rate of cells expressing intact permease to a comparable steady-state level of accumulation. In contrast, cells expressing either half of the permease independently do not transport lactose. As judged by [35S]methionine labeling and immunoblotting, intact permease is completely absent from the membrane of cells expressing lacY fragments either individually or together. Thus, transport activity must result from an association between independently synthesized pieces of lac permease. When the gene fragments are expressed individually, the N-terminal portion of the permease is observed inconsistently, and the C-terminal portion is not observed. When the gene fragments are expressed together, polypeptides identified as the N- and C-terminal moieties of the permease are found in the membrane. It is concluded that the N- or C-terminal halves of lac permease are proteolyzed when synthesized independently and that association between the two complementing polypeptides leads to a more stable, catalytically active complex.},

The quality control mechanisms that over-see these processes remain poorly understood. We show that less hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) re-gions derived from several single-pass TM proteins can enter the ER lumen completely. Once mislocal-ized, they are recognized by the Hsp70 chaperone BiP. In a detailed analysis for one of these proteins, the abT cell receptor (abTCR), we show that unas-sembled ER-lumenal subunits are rapidly degraded, whereas specific subunit interactions en route to the native receptor promote membrane integration of the less hydrophobic TM segments, thereby stabilizing the protein. For the TCR a chain, both complete ER import and subunit assembly depend on the same pivotal residue in its TM region. Thus, membrane integration linked to protein assembly allows cellular quality control of membrane proteins and connects the lumenal ER chaperone machinery to membrane protein biogenesis.},

Cytoplasmic segments of SecY orient the C-terminal $\alpha$-helical region of another molecule, suggesting a general binding mode and a promiscuous guiding surface capable of accommodating diverse nascent chains at the exit of the ribosomal tunnel. To accommodate this putative nascent chain mimic, the cytoplasmic vestibule widens, and a lateral exit portal is opened throughout its entire length for partition of transmembrane helical segments to the lipid bilayer. In this primed channel, the central plug still occludes the pore while the lateral gate is opened, enabling topological arbitration during early protein insertion. In vivo, a 15 amino acid truncation of the cytoplasmic C-terminal helix of SecY fails to rescue a secY-deficient strain, supporting the essential role of this helix as suggested from the structure.},

@article{Soekarjo,
abstract = {For the first time, the standard free energy change, ‚àÜG¬∞, of a membrane-inserting protein with a leader sequence has been determined experimentally, using M13 procoat protein as an example. The partition coefficient for the distribution of the procoat protein between the aqueous phase and the membrane phase of preformed lipid vesicles yielded a value of $\Gamma$) 6.5 √ó 10 5 M -1 , corresponding to a ‚àÜG¬∞ of -10.4 kcal/mol, based on measurements of the fluorescence energy transfer between the intrinsic tryptophan of the protein and a suitably labeled lipid membrane of POPC. For comparison, the partition coefficient of the M13 coat protein between the aqueous and the POPC lipid bilayer phase was determined to be distinctly lower: $\Gamma$) 1 √ó 10 5 M -1 (‚àÜG¬∞) -9.3 kcal/mol). Proteinase K digestion experiments have been performed, showing that 20{\%} of the procoat protein bound to lipid vesicles spontaneously integrate in a transbilayer form, whereas 80{\%} remain inserted in the interfacial membrane region. By taking together these results, an upper limit for the free energy change of the transmembrane insertion of procoat protein was estimated to be -14.8 kcal/mol. In order to distinguish further the contribution arising from insertion of the procoat protein into the membrane interfacial region from that due to transmembrane insertion, the partition coefficient of the mutant procoat protein OM30R [which contains a positively charged amino acid in its mature hydrophobic segment (exchange of a Val to an Arg residue at position 30)] was determined, yielding $\Gamma$) 0.3 √ó 10 5 M -1 (‚àÜG¬∞) -8.6 kcal/mol). Previously reported in ViVo experiments have shown that the OM30R mutant protein is not translocated across Escherichia coli membranes but only binds to the inner surface. The results presented here indicate that although the insertion of the procoat protein into the interfacial region of the lipid bilayer contributes the major part to ‚àÜG¬∞, it is the final energy gain of the interaction of the hydrophobic portions of the folded pre-protein with the lipid chains which drives the transmembrane insertion of the M13 procoat protein. Neither the leader sequence nor the mature coat protein alone yields this free energy gain. For the different proteins investigated here, spontaneous membrane insertion occurs only for fluid lipid bilayers, but not for membranes in the crystalline lipid phase. Furthermore, by using lipid bilayers with negative membrane surface charges, it was shown that both procoat and coat proteins are electrostatically attracted to the surface of the lipid membrane, though only to a small extent, with apparent partition coefficients of the same order of magnitude as for the phosphatidylcholine lipid membrane. The insertion of newly synthesized membrane proteins into lipid bilayers is in many cases directed by N-terminal signal (leader) sequences, that are removed from the mature part of the protein after insertion [for reviews, see von Heijne (1994) and Wickner (1988)]. Complicated protein insertion and translocation machineries have been characterized genetically and biochemically in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. However, there are several examples of relatively small proteins which insert into membranes independently of the translocation machinery. One classical example is the coat protein of the filamentous phage M13 (Kuhn, 1995; Broomesmith et al., 1994). The M13 coat protein is synthesized with a 23 amino acid long signal sequence in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli and is then inserted into the plasma membrane. The membrane insertion process of this so-called M13 procoat protein has been extensively studied genetically and bio-chemically (Kuhn {\&} Troschel, 1992). There are experimen-tal indications that the binding of the protein to the negatively charged membrane surface occurs via the positively charged amino acid residues at the amino and carboxy termini of the procoat protein (Gallusser {\&} Kuhn, 1990). The subsequent partitioning of the two hydrophobic regions into the mem-brane results in an U-like configuration. This in ViVo insertion process requires a transmembrane potential for the wild-type procoat protein (Kuhn {\&} Wickner, 1985). Bio-physical investigations have shown that at least part of the predicted transmembrane regions adopt an R-helical confor-mation (Thiaudi{\`{e}}re et al., 1993). The topology of this intermediate has been investigated using procoat proteins with either N-terminal or C-terminal extensions (Kuhn et al., 1986; Kuhn, 1987). It was also found that the N-and C-termini do not leave the cytoplasm during the insertion},

The extensive biophysical and topological diversity of membrane proteins necessitates multiple insertion pathways that remain incompletely defined. Here, we found that known membrane insertion pathways fail to effectively engage tail-anchored membrane proteins with moderately hydrophobic transmembrane domains. These proteins are instead shielded in the cytosol by calmodulin. Dynamic release from calmodulin allowed sampling of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the conserved ER membrane protein complex (EMC) was shown to be essential for efficient insertion in vitro and in cells. Purified EMC in synthetic liposomes catalyzed insertion of its substrates in a reconstituted system. Thus, EMC is a transmembrane domain insertase, a function that may explain its widely pleiotropic membrane-associated phenotypes across organisms.},

In Escherichia coli post- and co-translational targeting pathways converge at the protein-conducting channel, consisting of a central pore, SecYEG, which can recruit accessory domains SecDF-YajC and YidC, to form the holotranslocon (HTL) supercomplex. Detailed analysis of HTL function and architecture remained elusive until recently, largely due to the lack of a purified, recombinant complex. ACEMBL is an advanced DNA recombineering-based expression vector system we developed for producing challenging multiprotein complexes. ACEMBL affords the means to combine multiple expression elements including promoter DNAs, tags, genes of interest, and terminators in a combinatorial manner until optimal multigene expression plasmids are constructed that yield correctly assembled, homogenous, and active multiprotein complex specimens. We utilized ACEMBL for recombinant HTL overproduction. We developed protocols for detergent solubilizing and purifying the HTL. Highly purified complex was then used to reveal HTL function and the interactions between its constituents. HTL activity in protein secretion and membrane protein insertion was analyzed in both the presence and absence of the proton-motive force. Setting up ACEMBL for the assembly of multigene expression constructs that achieve high yields of functional multisubunit membrane protein complex is straightforward. Here, we used ACEMBL for obtaining active HTL supercomplex in high quality and quantity. The concept can likewise be applied to obtain many other assemblies of similar complexity, by overexpression in prokaryotic, and also eukaryotic hosts.},

Here, we have used translational arrest peptides as in vivo force sensors to measure this electric force during cotranslational chain translocation through the SecYEG translocon. We find that charged residues experience a biphasic electric force as they move across the membrane, including an early component with a maximum when they are 47-49 residues away from the ribosomal P site, followed by a more slowly varying component. The early component is generated by the transmembrane electric potential, whereas the second may reflect interactions between charged residues and the periplasmic membrane surface.},

abstract = {Calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs) formed by TMEM16A or TMEM16B are broadly expressed in¬†the nervous system, smooth muscles, exocrine glands, and other tissues. With two calcium-binding sites and a pore within each monomer, the dimeric CaCC exhibits voltage-dependent calcium sensitivity. Channel activity also depends on the identity of permeant anions. To understand how CaCC regulates neuronal signaling and how CaCC is, in turn, modulated by neuronal activity, we examined the molecular basis of CaCC gating. Here, we report¬†that voltage modulation of TMEM16A-CaCC involves voltage-dependent occupancy of calcium- and anion-binding site(s) within the membrane electric field as well as a voltage-dependent conformational change intrinsic to the channel protein. These gating modalities all critically depend on the sixth transmembrane segment.},

abstract = {A defining feature of eukaryotic polytopic protein biogenesis involves integration, folding, and packing of hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) segments into the apolar environment of the lipid bilayer. In the endoplasmic reticulum, this process is facilitated by the Sec61 translocon. Here, we use a photocross-linking approach to examine integration intermediates derived from the ATP-binding cassette transporter cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and show that the timing of translocon-mediated integration can be regulated at specific stages of synthesis. During CFTR biogenesis, the eighth TM segment exits the ribosome and enters the translocon in proximity to Sec61alpha. This interaction is initially weak, and TM8 spontaneously dissociates from the translocon when the nascent chain is released from the ribosome. Polypeptide extension by only a few residues, however, results in stable TM8-Sec61alpha photocross-links that persist after peptidyl-tRNA bond cleavage. Retention of these untethered polypeptides within the translocon requires ribosome binding and is mediated by an acidic residue, Asp924, near the center of the putative TM8 helix. Remarkably, at this stage of synthesis, nascent chain release from the translocon is also strongly inhibited by ATP depletion. These findings contrast with passive partitioning models and indicate that Sec61alpha can retain TMs and actively inhibit membrane integration in a sequence-specific and ATP-dependent manner.},

We reconstituted the core reactions for membrane targeting and ubiquitination of nascent tail-anchored membrane proteins to understand how their fate is determined. The central six-component triage system is divided into an uncommitted client-SGTA complex, a self-sufficient targeting module, and an embedded but self-sufficient quality control module. Client-SGTA engagement of the targeting module induces rapid, private, and committed client transfer to TRC40 for successful biosynthesis. Commitment to ubiquitination is dictated primarily by comparatively slower client dissociation from SGTA and nonprivate capture by the BAG6 subunit of the quality control module. Our results provide a paradigm for how priority and time are encoded within a multichaperone triage system.},

Programs sequence (SEG) and protein sequence (PSEG) are tuned for amino acid sequences and nucleotide sequence (NSEG) for nucleotide sequences. The programs can be applied to either individual sequences, including whole chromosomes if appropriate, or entire sequence databases. Compositional complexity is based only on residue composition, regardless of the patterns or periodicity of sequence repetitiveness. This contrasts with some alternative methods that use counts of k-grams to define residue patterns and clustering. Complexity, pattern, and periodicity are distinct abstract attributes of simple sequences. For genomic studies, it is essential to view compositional bias in the context of many types of other features, such as recognizable functional sites, transcripts, coding sequences, and homologies. For this purpose, the SEG family of programs is being integrated into software packages, or workbenches, that have graphic multilevel browsing facilities and include zoom functions.},

abstract = {The genomes of individuals with severe, undiagnosed developmental disorders are enriched in damaging de novo mutations (DNMs) in developmentally important genes. Here we have sequenced the exomes of 4,293 families containing individuals with developmental disorders, and meta-analysed these data with data from another 3,287 individuals with similar disorders. We show that the most important factors influencing the diagnostic yield of DNMs are the sex of the affected individual, the relatedness of their parents, whether close relatives are affected and the parental ages. We identified 94 genes enriched in damaging DNMs, including 14 that previously lacked compelling evidence of involvement in developmental disorders. We have also characterized the phenotypic diversity among these disorders. We estimate that 42{\%} of our cohort carry pathogenic DNMs in coding sequences; approximately half of these DNMs disrupt gene function and the remainder result in altered protein function. We estimate that developmental disorders caused by DNMs have an average prevalence of 1 in 213 to 1 in 448 births, depending on parental age. Given current global demographics, this equates to almost 400,000 children born per year. Approximately 2‚Äì5{\%} of children are born with major congenital mal-formations and/or manifest severe neurodevelopmental disorders during childhood 1,2 . Although diverse factors, including gestational infection and maternal alcohol consumption, can cause such devel-opmental disorders (DDs), damaging genetic variation in develop-mentally important genes makes a major contribution. Several recent studies have identified a substantial causal role for DNMs that are not present in either parent 3‚Äì16 . Despite the identification of many DDs caused by DNMs, it is generally accepted that many more disorders have not yet been discovered 15 , and the overall contribution of DNMs to DDs is not known. Moreover, some pathogenic DNMs completely ablate the encoded protein, whereas others instead alter the function of the encoded protein 17 ; the relative contributions of these two mech-anistic classes are also not known. We recruited 4,293 individuals to the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) study 15 via the genetics services of the UK National Health Service and the Republic of Ireland. Each of these individuals was referred with a severe undiagnosed DD and most were the only affected family member. Most individuals (81{\%}) had been screened for large pathogenic deletions and duplications. We systematically phe-notyped these individuals and sequenced the exomes of the affected individuals and their parents. Growth measurements, family history and developmental milestones were recorded, and detailed clinical phenotypes were captured using Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. Analyses of 1,133 of these individuals have been described previ-ously 15,18},

Young adult male Sprague‚ÄìDawley rats were fed one of twelve moderate-fat diets (25{\%} of total energy) for 8weeks. Diets differed only in fatty acid (FA) profiles, with saturate (SFA) content ranging 8‚Äì88{\%} of total FAs, monounsaturate (MUFA) 6‚Äì65{\%}, total PUFA 4‚Äì81{\%}, n‚àí6 PUFA 3‚Äì70{\%} and n‚àí3 PUFA 1‚Äì70{\%}. Diet PUFA included only essential FAs 18:2n‚àí6 and 18:3n‚àí3. Balance between n‚àí3 and n‚àí6 PUFA is defined as the PUFA balance (n‚àí3 PUFA as {\%} of total PUFA) and ranged 1‚Äì86{\%} in the diets. FA composition was measured for brain, heart, liver, skeletal muscle, erythrocytes and plasma phospholipids, as well as adipose tissue and plasma triglycerides. The conformer‚Äìregulator model was used (slope=1 indicates membrane composition completely conforming to diet). Extensive changes in diet SFA, MUFA and PUFA had minimal effect on membranes (average slopes 0.01, 0.07, 0.07 respectively), but considerable influence on adipose tissue and plasma triglycerides (average slopes 0.27, 0.53, 0.47 respectively).

abstract = {SWEETs and their prokaryotic homologues are monosaccharide and disaccharide transporters that are present from Archaea to plants and humans. SWEETs play crucial roles in cellular sugar efflux processes: that is, in phloem loading, pollen nutrition and nectar secretion. Their bacterial homologues, which are called SemiSWEETs, are among the smallest known transporters. Here we show that SemiSWEET molecules, which consist of a triple-helix bundle, form symmetrical, parallel dimers, thereby generating the translocation pathway. Two SemiSWEET isoforms were crystallized, one in an apparently open state and one in an occluded state, indicating that SemiSWEETs and SWEETs are transporters that undergo rocking-type movements during the transport cycle. The topology of the triple-helix bundle is similar yet distinct to that of the basic building block of animal and plant major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters (for example, GLUTs and SUTs). This finding indicates two possibilities: that SWEETs and MFS transporters evolved from an ancestral triple-helix bundle or that the triple-helix bundle represents convergent evolution. In SemiSWEETs and SWEETs, two triple-helix bundles are arranged in a parallel configuration to produce the 6- and 6 + 1-transmembrane-helix pores, respectively. In the 12-transmembrane-helix MFS transporters, four triple-helix bundles are arranged into an alternating antiparallel configuration, resulting in a much larger 2 √ó 2 triple-helix bundle forming the pore. Given the similarity of SemiSWEETs and SWEETs to PQ-loop amino acid transporters and to mitochondrial pyruvate carriers (MPCs), the structures characterized here may also be relevant to other transporters in the MtN3 clan. The insight gained from the structures of these transporters and from the analysis of mutations of conserved residues will improve the understanding of the transport mechanism, as well as allow comparative studies of the different superfamilies involved in sugar transport and the evolution of transporters in general.},

abstract = {Voltage-gated calcium channels are required for many key functions in the body. In this review, the different subtypes of voltage-gated calcium channels are described and their physiologic roles and pharmacology are outlined. We describe the current uses of drugs interacting with the different calcium channel subtypes and subunits, as well as specific areas in which there is strong potential for future drug development. Current therapeutic agents include drugs targeting L-type Ca(V)1.2 calcium channels, particularly 1,4-dihydropyridines, which are widely used in the treatment of hypertension. T-type (Ca(V)3) channels are a target of ethosuximide, widely used in absence epilepsy. The auxiliary subunit $\alpha$2$\delta$-1 is the therapeutic target of the gabapentinoid drugs, which are of value in certain epilepsies and chronic neuropathic pain. The limited use of intrathecal ziconotide, a peptide blocker of N-type (Ca(V)2.2) calcium channels, as a treatment of intractable pain, gives an indication that these channels represent excellent drug targets for various pain conditions. We describe how selectivity for different subtypes of calcium channels (e.g., Ca(V)1.2 and Ca(V)1.3 L-type channels) may be achieved in the future by exploiting differences between channel isoforms in terms of sequence and biophysical properties, variation in splicing in different target tissues, and differences in the properties of the target tissues themselves in terms of membrane potential or firing frequency. Thus, use-dependent blockers of the different isoforms could selectively block calcium channels in particular pathologies, such as nociceptive neurons in pain states or in epileptic brain circuits. Of important future potential are selective Ca(V)1.3 blockers for neuropsychiatric diseases, neuroprotection in Parkinson's disease, and resistant hypertension. In addition, selective or nonselective T-type channel blockers are considered potential therapeutic targets in epilepsy, pain, obesity, sleep, and anxiety. Use-dependent N-type calcium channel blockers are likely to be of therapeutic use in chronic pain conditions. Thus, more selective calcium channel blockers hold promise for therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) oligomerization has emerged as a vital characteristic of receptor structure. Substantial experimental evidence supports the existence of GPCR-GPCR interactions in a coordinated and cooperative manner. However, despite the current development of experimental techniques for large-scale detection of GPCR heteromers, in order to understand their connectivity it is necessary to develop novel tools to study the global heteroreceptor networks. To provide insight into the overall topology of the GPCR heteromers and identify key players, a collective interaction network was constructed. Experimental interaction data for each of the individual human GPCR protomers was obtained manually from the STRING and SCOPUS databases. The interaction data were used to build and analyze the network using Cytoscape software. The network was treated as undirected throughout the study. It is comprised of 156 nodes, 260 edges and has a scale-free topology. Connectivity analysis reveals a significant dominance of intrafamily versus interfamily connections. Most of the receptors within the network are linked to each other by a small number of edges. DRD2, OPRM, ADRB2, AA2AR, AA1R, OPRK, OPRD and GHSR are identified as hubs. In a network representation 10 modules/clusters also appear as a highly interconnected group of nodes. Information on this GPCR network can improve our understanding of molecular integration. GPCR-HetNet has been implemented in Java and is freely available at http://www.iiia.csic.es/similar to ismel/GPCR-Nets/index.html.},

abstract = {Rhomboid proteases reside within cellular membranes, but the advantage of this unusual environment is unclear. We discovered membrane immersion allows substrates to be identified in a fundamentally-different way, based initially upon exposing 'masked' conformational dynamics of transmembrane segments rather than sequence-specific binding. EPR and CD spectroscopy revealed that the membrane restrains rhomboid gate and substrate conformation to limit proteolysis. True substrates evolved intrinsically-unstable transmembrane helices that both become unstructured when not supported by the membrane, and facilitate partitioning into the hydrophilic, active-site environment. Accordingly, manipulating substrate and gate dynamics in living cells shifted cleavage sites in a manner incompatible with extended sequence binding, but correlated with a membrane-and-helix-exit propensity scale. Moreover, cleavage of diverse non-substrates was provoked by single-residue changes that destabilize transmembrane helices. Membrane immersion thus bestows rhomboid proteases with the ability to identify substrates primarily based on reading their intrinsic transmembrane dynamics.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00173.001.},

abstract = {Voltage-gated calcium channels are required for many key functions in the body. In this review, the different subtypes of voltage-gated calcium channels are described and their physiologic roles and pharmacology are outlined. We describe the current uses of drugs interacting with the different calcium channel subtypes and subunits, as well as specific areas in which there is strong potential for future drug development. Current therapeutic agents include drugs targeting L-type CaV1.2 calcium channels, particularly 1,4-dihydropyridines, which are widely used in the treatment of hypertension. T-type (CaV3) channels are a target of ethosuximide, widely used in absence epilepsy. The auxiliary subunit a2d-1 is the therapeutic target of the gabapentinoid drugs, which are of value in certain epilepsies and chronic neuropathic pain. The limited use of intrathecal ziconotide, a peptide blocker of N-type (CaV2.2) calcium channels, as a treatment of intractable pain, gives an indication that these channels represent excellent drug targets for various pain conditions. We describe how selectivity for different subtypes of calcium channels (e.g., CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 L-type channels) may be achieved in the future by exploiting differences between channel isoforms in terms of sequence and biophysical properties, variation in splicing in different target tissues, and differences in the properties of the target tissues themselves in terms of membrane potential or firing frequency. Thus, use-dependent blockers of the different isoforms could selectively block calcium channels in particular pathologies, such as nociceptive neurons in pain states or in epileptic brain circuits. Of important future potential are selective CaV1.3 blockers for neuropsychiatric diseases, neuroprotection in Parkinson's disease, and resistant hypertension. In addition, selective or nonselective T-type channel blockers are considered potential therapeutic targets in epilepsy, pain, obesity, sleep, and anxiety. Use-dependent N-type calcium channel blockers are likely to be of therapeutic use in chronic pain conditions. Thus, more selective calcium channel blockers hold promise for therapeutic intervention. {\textcopyright} 2015 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.},

abstract = {Cl- channels reside both in the plasma membrane and in intracellular organelles. Their functions range from ion homeostasis to cell volume regulation, transepithelial transport, and regulation of electrical excitability. Their physiological roles are impressively illustrated by various inherited diseases and knock-out mouse models. Thus the loss of distinct Cl- channels leads to an impairment of transepithelial transport in cystic fibrosis and Bartter's syndrome, to increased muscle excitability in myotonia congenita, to reduced endosomal acidification and impaired endocytosis in Dent's disease, and to impaired extracellular acidification by osteoclasts and osteopetrosis. The disruption of several Cl- channels in mice results in blindness. Several classes of Cl- channels have not yet been identified at the molecular level. Three molecularly distinct Cl- channel families (CLC, CFTR, and ligand-gated GABA and glycine receptors) are well established. Mutagenesis and functional studies have yielded considerable insights into their structure and function. Recently, the detailed structure of bacterial CLC proteins was determined by X-ray analysis of three-dimensional crystals. Nonetheless, they are less well understood than cation channels and show remarkably different biophysical and structural properties. Other gene families (CLIC or CLCA) were also reported to encode Cl- channels but are less well characterized. This review focuses on molecularly identified Cl- channels and their physiological roles.},

The formation of these oligomeric structures, including both biogenesis and trafficking, is the subject of this review. The emphasis is on events in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), particularly on how, where, and when K(+) channel polypeptides translocate and integrate into the bilayer, oligomerize and fold to form pore-forming units, and associate with auxiliary subunits to create the mature channel complex. Questions are raised with respect to the sequence of these events, when biogenic decisions are made, models for integration of K(+) channel transmembrane segments, crosstalk between the cell surface and ER, and recognition of compatible partner subunits. Also considered are determinants of subunit composition and stoichiometry, their consequence for trafficking, mechanisms for ER retention and export, and sequence motifs that direct channels to the cell surface. It is these mechanistic issues that govern the differential distributions of K(+) conductances at the cell surface, and hence the electrical activity of cells and tissues underlying both the physiology and pathophysiology of an organism.},

abstract = {Transmembrane proteins (TMPs) are important drug targets because they are essential for signaling, regulation, and transport. Despite important breakthroughs, experimental structure determination remains challenging for TMPs. Various methods have bridged the gap by predicting transmembrane helices (TMHs), but room for improvement remains. Here, we present TMSEG, a novel method identifying TMPs and accurately predicting their TMHs and their topology. The method combines machine learning with empirical filters. Testing it on a non-redundant dataset of 41 TMPs and 285 soluble proteins, and applying strict performance measures, TMSEG outperformed the state-of-the-art in our hands. TMSEG correctly distinguished helical TMPs from other proteins with a sensitivity of 98¬±2{\%} and a false positive rate as low as 3¬±1{\%}. Individual TMHs were predicted with a precision of 87¬±3{\%} and recall of 84¬±3{\%}. Furthermore, in 63¬±6{\%} of helical TMPs the placement of all TMHs and their inside/outside topology was correctly predicted. There are two main features that distinguish TMSEG from other methods. First, the errors in finding all helical TMPs in an organism are significantly reduced. For example, in human this leads to 200 and 1600 fewer misclassifications compared to the 2(nd) and 3(rd) best method available, and 4400 fewer mistakes than by a simple hydrophobicity-based method. Second, TMSEG provides an add-on improvement for any existing method to benefit from. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Membrane proteins are involved in fundamental biological processes like ion, wa- ter, or solute transport, sensing changes in the cellular environment, signal transduc- tion, and control of cell-cell contacts required to maintain cellular homeostasis and to ensure coordinated cellular activity in all organisms. Because of the importance of these proteins to living cells, their dysfunctions are responsible for numerous pathologies like cancer, cystic fibrosis, epilepsy, hyperinsulinism, heart failure, hy- pertension, and Alzheimer diseases. However, studies on these and other disorders are hampered by a lack of information about the involved proteins. Knowing the structure of these proteins and understanding their molecular mechanism is not only of fundamental biological interest, but also holds great potential for enhancing hu- man health. This is of paramount importance in the pharmaceutical industry, which produces many drugs that bind to membrane proteins and which recognizes the po- tential of many recently identified G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion chan- nels, and transporters, as targets for future drugs. Fifty percent of all drug targets are GPCRs, which is one of the largest and most diverse membrane protein families. Whereas high-resolution structures are available for a myriad of soluble proteins (more than 42,000 in the Protein Data Bank), atomic structures have so far been obtained for only 424 membrane pro- teins. Remarkably, this number is growing exponentially with 100 new structures determined in the last two years. However, only ten percent of membrane protein structures are derived from vertebrates. Indeed, the majority of medically and phar- maceutically relevant mammalian membrane proteins are present in tissues at very low concentration, making production of recombinant proteins in heterologous sys- tems suitable for large-scale production a prerequisite for structural studies. For the majority of mammalian membrane proteins, the production of soluble, stable and correctly folded protein is challenging. The breakthrough occurred in 2005 with the two first atomic structures of recombinant mammalian membrane proteins ob- tained from proteins overexpressed in yeast: the calcium ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum SERCA1A and the Kv1.2 voltage-gated potassium channel. Since then, extensive optimization of heterologous expression systems, stabilization tools, and structural analysis methods has begun to bear fruit, and the structure of 37 recombinant mammalian membrane proteins have been solved. With this book, we compiled some advances in heterologous expression systems, stabilization tools and structural methods that contributed to the growing number of recombinant integral membrane protein structures solved these in the past few years. It will also facilitate the structural analysis of many other membrane proteins. I want to thank the authors of each chapter for their contribution to this book.

abstract = {The discovery of disordered proteins, which constitute about one-third of the human proteome and are crucial for regulation and signaling 1‚Äì3 , has profoundly shaken the long-held paradigm that proteins fold into well-defined native structures whose atomic coordinates can be determined almost univocally. This finding has been followed by a polarization of the terms 'order' and 'disorder' , which, in hindsight, has been largely prompted by a lack of techniques capable of fully characterizing the dynamics of proteins. Protein disorder was initially defined as 'absence of structure' , for example, from regions of missing coordinates in native structures determined through X-ray crystallography 1‚Äì3 . Such a definition implies that order and disorder are mutually exclusive, while in fact protein structures and dynamics are closely related and central to the functions of these molecules. In this Commentary, we discuss how the development of methods capable of simultaneously determining structure and dynamics of proteins, including, in particular, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, is gradually making it possible to supersede this rather artificial polarization between order and disorder. We anticipate that the introduction of increasingly quantitative descriptions of structure and dynamics will provide compelling insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying protein behavior.},

abstract = {The function of membrane proteins relies on a defined orientation of protein relative to lipid. In apparent correlation to protein anchoring, tryptophan residues are enriched in the lipid headgroup region. To characterize the thermodynamic and structural basis of this relationship in $\alpha$-helical membrane proteins, we examined the role of three conserved tryptophans in the folding of the heterodimeric integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 transmembrane (TM) complex in phospholipid bicelles and mammalian membranes. In the homogenous lipid environment of bicelles, tryptophan was replaceable by residues of distinct polarities. The appropriate polarity was guided by the electrostatic potential of the tryptophan surrounding, suggesting that tryptophan can complement diverse environments by adjusting the orientation of its anisotropic side chain to achieve site-specific anchoring. As a sole membrane anchor, tryptophan made a contribution of 0.4 kcal/mol to TM complex stability in bicelles. In membranes, it proved more difficult to replace tryptophan even by tyrosine, indicating a superior capacity to interact with heterogeneous lipids of biological membranes. Interestingly, at intracellular TM helix ends, where integrin activation is initiated, sequence motifs that interact with lipids via opposing polarity patterns were found to restrict TM helix orientations beyond tryptophan anchoring. In contrast to bicelles, phenylalanine became the least accepted substitute in membranes, demonstrating an increased role of the hydrophobic effect. Altogether, our study implicates a wide amphiphilic range of tryptophan, membrane complexity, and the hydrophobic effect to be important factors in tryptophan membrane anchoring.},

An understanding of drug-protein target interactions in specific cellular compartments is crucial for the optimal therapeutic delivery of pharmaceutical agents, as well as for preclinical drug trials in model animals. This study applied the concept of pharmacophylogenomics, the study of genes, evolution, and drug targets, to conduct an evolutionary survey of drug targets with respect to their subcellular localizations. Using multiple models and modes of druggable genome comparison, the results concordantly indicated that orthologous drug targets with a nuclear localization in the human, macaque, mouse, and rat showed a higher trend for evolutionary conservation compared with drug targets in the cell membrane and the extracellular compartment. As such, this study provides important information regarding druggable protein targets and the druggable genome at the pharmacophylogenomics level.},

abstract = {The coarse-grained Martini model is employed extensively to study membrane protein oligomerization. While this approach is exceptionally promising given its computational effi- ciency, it is alarming that a significant fraction of these studies demonstrate unrealistic pro- tein clusters, whose formation is essentially an irreversible process. This suggests that the protein‚Äìprotein interactions are exaggerated in the Martini model. If this held true, then it would limit the applicability of Martini to study multi-protein complexes, as the rapidly cluster- ing proteins would not be able to properly sample the correct dimerization conformations. In this work we first demonstrate the excessive protein aggregation by comparing the dimeriza- tion free energies of helical transmembrane peptides obtained with the Martini model to those determined from FRET experiments. Second, we show that the predictions provided by the Martini model for the structures of transmembrane domain dimers are in poor agree- ment with the corresponding structures resolved using NMR. Next, we demonstrate that the first issue can be overcome by slightly scaling down the Martini protein‚Äìprotein interactions in a manner, which does not interfere with the other Martini interaction parameters. By pre- venting excessive, irreversible, and non-selective aggregation of membrane proteins, this approach renders the consideration of lateral dynamics and protein‚Äìlipid interactions in crowded membranes by the Martini model more realistic. However, this adjusted model does not lead to an improvement in the predicted dimer structures. This implicates that the poor agreement between the Martini model andNMRstructures cannot be cured by simply uniformly reducing the interactions between all protein beads. Instead, a careful amino-acid specific adjustment of the protein‚Äìprotein interactions is likely required.},

How a cell manages to generate equal populations of two opposite topologies from the same polypeptide chain remains unclear. For the dual-topology transporter EmrE, the evidence to date remains consistent with two extreme models. A post-translational model posits that topology remains malleable after synthesis and becomes fixed once the dimer forms. A second, co-translational model, posits that the protein inserts in both topologies in equal proportions. Here we show that while there is at least some limited topological malleability, the co-translational model likely dominates under normal circumstances.},

abstract = {The Sec61 translocon catalyzes translocation of proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum and the lateral integration of transmembrane segments into the lipid bilayer. Integration is mediated by the hydrophobicity of a polypeptide segment consistent with thermodynamic equilibration between the translocon and the lipid membrane. Integration efficiency of a generic series of increasingly hydrophobic sequences (H-segments) was found to diverge significantly in different reporter constructs as a function of the ‚àº100 residues that are C-terminal to the H-segments. The hydrophobicity threshold of integration was considerably lowered through insertion of generic ‚àº20-residue peptides either made of flexible glycine-serine repeats, containing multiple negative charges, or consisting of an oligoproline stretch. A highly flexible, 100-residue glycine-serine stretch maximally enhanced this effect. The apparent free energy of integration was found to be changed by more than 3 kcal/mol with the downstream sequences tested. The C-terminal sequences could also be shown to affect integration of natural mildly hydrophobic sequences. The results suggest that the conformation of the nascent polypeptide in the protected cavity between the ribosome and translocon considerably influences the release of the H-segment into the bilayer.},

abstract = {Binding of the retroviral structural protein Gag to the cellular plasma membrane is mediated by the protein's matrix (MA) domain. Prominent among MA-PM interactions is electrostatic attraction between the positively charged MA domain and the negatively charged plasma membrane inner leaflet. Previously, we reported that membrane association of HIV-1 Gag, as well as purified Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) MA and Gag, depends strongly on the presence of acidic lipids and is enhanced by cholesterol (Chol). The mechanism underlying this enhancement was unclear. Here, using a broad set of in¬†vitro and in¬†silico techniques we addressed molecular mechanisms of association between RSV MA and model membranes, and investigated how Chol enhances this association. In neutron scattering experiments with liposomes in the presence or absence of Chol, MA preferentially interacted with preexisting POPS-rich clusters formed by nonideal lipid mixing, binding peripherally to the lipid headgroups with minimal perturbation to the bilayer structure. Molecular dynamics simulations showed a stronger MA-bilayer interaction in the presence of Chol, and a large Chol-driven increase in lipid packing and membrane surface charge density. Although in¬†vitro MA-liposome association is influenced by disparate variables, including ionic strength and concentrations of Chol and charged lipids, continuum electrostatic theory revealed an underlying dependence on membrane surface potential. Together, these results conclusively show that Chol affects RSV MA-membrane association by making the electrostatic potential at the membrane surface more negative, while decreasing the penalty for lipid headgroup desolvation. The presented approach can be applied to other viral and nonviral proteins.},

Translocation of DNA is a crucial step in nanopore-based sequencing platforms, where control over translocation speed remains one of the main challenges. Taking advantage of the interactions between negatively charged DNA and positively charged amino acid residues, the translocation speed of DNA can be manipulated by deliberate charge decorations inside the nanopore. We employed coarse-grained Langevin dynamics simulations to monitor the step-by-step movement of DNA through different mutations of $\alpha$-hemolysin protein nanopores. We found that although the average translocation time per nucleotide is longer, in agreement with experiments, the DNA nucleotides do not translocate with a uniform speed. Furthermore, the location and spacing of the charge decorations can alter the translocation dynamics significantly, trapping DNA in some cases. Our findings can give insights when designing charge patterns in nanopores.},

abstract = {A site-specific cross-linking approach was used to study the integration of TM (transmembrane) segments 4-7 of the polytopic membrane protein, opsin, at the ER (endoplasmic reticulum). We found that although TM4 exits the ER translocon rapidly, TM segments 5, 6 and 7 are all retained at the translocon until opsin biosynthesis is terminated. Furthermore, although artificial extension of the nascent chain is not sufficient to release the C-terminal region of opsin from the translocon, substitution of the native TM segment 7 with a more hydrophobic TM segment results in its rapid lateral exit into the lipid bilayer. We conclude that the intrinsic properties of a TM segment determine the timing of its membrane integration rather than its relative location within the polypeptide chain. A pronounced and prolonged association of opsin TM5 with the translocon-associated component PAT-10 was also observed, suggesting that PAT-10 may facilitate the assembly of distinct opsin subdomains during membrane integration. The results of the present study strongly support a model in which the ER translocon co-ordinates the integration of selected TM segments in response to the specific requirements of the precursor being synthesized.},

An amino-terminal helix location underpins the covalent linkage for one class of kinase inhibitors. Cysteine targets for S-palmitoylation, S-glutathionylation, and S-nitrosylation show little correlation with pKa values predicted from structures, although flanking sequences of S-palmitoylated sites are enriched in positively-charged amino acids, which could facilitate palmitoyl group transfer to substrate cysteine. A surprisingly large fraction of modified sites, across the three modifications, would be buried in native protein structure. Furthermore, modified cysteines are (on average) closer to lysine ubiquitinations than are unmodified cysteines, indicating that cysteine redox biology could be associated with protein degradation and degron recognition.},

In the absence of YidC, unfolded LacY inserts individual structural segments into the membrane; however, misfolding dominates the process so that folding cannot be completed. YidC prevents LacY from misfolding by stabilizing the unfolded state from which LacY inserts structural segments stepwise into the membrane until folding is completed. During stepwise insertion, YidC and the membrane together stabilize the transient folds. Remarkably, the order of insertion of structural segments is stochastic, indicating that LacY can fold along variable pathways toward the native structure. Since YidC is essential in membrane protein biogenesis and LacY is a model for the major facilitator superfamily, our observations have general relevance.},

J. Singer and G. L. Nicolson, Science 175 (1972) 720-731]. After over 40 years, this basic model of the cell membrane remains relevant for describing the basic nano-structures of a variety of intracellular and cellular membranes of plant and animal cells and lower forms of life. In the intervening years, however, new information has documented the importance and roles of specialized membrane domains, such as lipid rafts and protein/glycoprotein complexes, in describing the macrostructure, dynamics and functions of cellular membranes as well as the roles of membrane-associated cytoskeletal fences and extracellular matrix structures in limiting the lateral diffusion and range of motion of membrane components. These newer data build on the foundation of the original model and add new layers of complexity and hierarchy, but the concepts described in the original model are still applicable today. In updated versions of the model more emphasis has been placed on the mosaic nature of the macrostructure of cellular membranes where many protein and lipid components are limited in their rotational and lateral motilities in the membrane plane, especially in their natural states where lipid-lipid, protein-protein and lipid-protein interactions as well as cell-matrix, cell-cell and intracellular membrane-associated protein and cytoskeletal interactions are important in restraining the lateral motility and range of motion of particular membrane components. The formation of specialized membrane domains and the presence of tightly packed integral membrane protein complexes due to membrane-associated fences, fenceposts and other structures are considered very important in describing membrane dynamics and architecture. These structures along with membrane-associated cytoskeletal and extracellular structures maintain the long-range, non-random mosaic macro-organization of membranes, while smaller membrane nano- and submicro-sized domains, such as lipid rafts and protein complexes, are important in maintaining specialized membrane structures that are in cooperative dynamic flux in a crowded membrane plane.

Here, we focus on antiparallel homo- or heterodimeric small multidrug resistance proteins and examine whether the individual monomers can undergo reversible topological inversion (flip flop) in the membrane until they are trapped in a fixed orientation by dimerization. By perturbing dimerization using various means, we show that the membrane orientation of a monomer is unaffected by the presence or absence of its dimerization partner. Thus, membrane-inserted monomers attain their final orientations independently of dimerization, suggesting that wholesale topological inversion is an unlikely event in vivo.},

abstract = {Intrinsic disorder is common in integral mem-brane proteins, particularly in the intracellular domains. Despite this observation, these domains are not always rec-ognized as being disordered. In this review, we will discuss the biological functions of intrinsically disordered regions of membrane proteins, and address why the flexibility afforded by disorder is mechanistically important. Intrinsically dis-ordered regions are present in many common classes of membrane proteins including ion channels and transporters; G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), receptor tyrosine kinases and cytokine receptors. The functions of the disor-dered regions are many and varied. We will discuss selected examples including: (1) Organization of receptors, kinases, phosphatases and second messenger sources into signaling complexes. (2) Modulation of the membrane-embedded domain function by ball-and-chain like mechanisms. (3) Trafficking of membrane proteins. (4) Transient membrane associations. (5) Post-translational modifications most notably phosphorylation and (6) disorder-linked isoform dependent function. We finish the review by discussing the future challenges facing the membrane protein community regarding protein disorder.},

abstract = {Any two unrelated individuals differ by about 10,000 single amino acid variants (SAVs). Do these impact molecular function? Experimental answers cannot answer comprehensively, while state-of-the-art prediction methods can. We predicted the functional impacts of SAVs within human and for variants between human and other species. Several surprising results stood out. Firstly, four methods (CADD, PolyPhen-2, SIFT, and SNAP2) agreed within 10 percentage points on the percentage of rare SAVs predicted with effect. However, they differed substantially for the common SAVs: SNAP2 predicted, on average, more effect for common than for rare SAVs. Given the large ExAC data sets sampling 60,706 individuals, the differences were extremely significant (p-value‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ2.2e-16). We provided evidence that SNAP2 might be closer to reality for common SAVs than the other methods, due to¬†its different focus in development. Secondly, we predicted significantly higher fractions of SAVs with effect between healthy individuals than between species; the difference increased for more distantly related species. The same trends were maintained for subsets of only housekeeping proteins and when moving from exomes of 1,000 to 60,000 individuals. SAVs frozen at speciation might maintain protein function, while many variants within a species might bring about crucial changes, for better or worse.},

Whereas the structural integrity seems to be preserved in detergents for many membrane proteins, their functional activity is frequently compromised, but can be restored in a lipid environment. Herein we show with per-residue resolution that while OmpX forms a stable $\beta$-barrel in DPC detergent micelles, DHPC/DMPC bicelles, and DMPC nanodiscs, the pico- to nanosecond and micro- to millisecond motions differ substantially between the detergent and lipid environment. In particular for the $\beta$-strands, there is pronounced dynamic variability in the lipid environment, which appears to be suppressed in micelles. This unexpected complex and membrane-mimetic-dependent dynamic behavior indicates that the frequent loss of membrane protein activity in detergents might be related to reduced internal dynamics and that membrane protein activity correlates with lipid flexibility.},

This exciting progress has required the development of three complementary methods to facilitate GPCR crystallization, one of which is the thermostabilization of receptors by systematic mutagenesis. However, the reason why a particular mutation, or combination of mutations, stabilizes the receptor is not always evident from a static crystal structure. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to identify and estimate the energetic factors that affect thermostability through comparing the dynamics of the thermostabilized receptors with structure-based models of the wild-type receptor. The data indicate that receptors are stabilized through a combination of factors, including an increase in receptor rigidity, a decrease in collective motion, reduced stress at specific residues, and the presence of ordered water molecules. Predicting thermostabilizing mutations computationally represents a major challenge for the field.},

All these levels, including single-molecule interactions (e.g., dimerization, liganding, chemical modifications), local processes (e.g. lipid membrane perturbations, cytoskeletal interactions), and larger scale phenomena (e.g., effects of membrane surface shape or electrochemical potential gradients) appear to be closely integrated to achieve the observed diversity of the receptor functioning. Different species of receptor protein kinases meet their specific functional demands through different structural features defining their responses to stimulation, but certain common patterns exist. Signaling by receptor protein kinases is typically associated with the receptor dimerization and clustering, ligand-induced rearrangements of receptor domains through allosteric conformational transitions with involvement of lipids, release of the sequestered lipids, restriction of receptor diffusion, cytoskeleton and membrane shape remodeling. Understanding of complexity and continuity of the signaling processes can help identifying currently neglected opportunities for influencing the receptor signaling with potential therapeutic implications.

@article{Akopian2013,
abstract = {Proteins are built as long chain-like molecules. First, a length of DNA is copied to make a messenger RNA (or mRNA) molecule, which then binds to a large molecular complex called a ribosome. The ribosome reads and translates the code in the mRNA sequence to build a protein chain, which then folds into a specific three-dimensional shape to allow the protein to perform its function. Many proteins also need to be targeted to the right location within the cell in order to carry out their role. Some proteins have to be inserted into the membranes of cells and these proteins are directed, as they are being built, to the membrane by another molecular complex called the signal recognition particle (or SRP for short). The SRP binds to the new protein as it emerges from the ribosome and helps to direct it to the membrane. To make sure that membrane proteins fold correctly, their translation is paused whilst the protein is being targeted to the membrane. Plants, animals, and other eukaryotes do this via a unique part of the SRP complex that only allows the translation to continue once the translating ribosome has been brought close to the membrane. However, most bacteria lack this part of the SRP complex, and yet they are still able to accurately insert new, correctly folded, proteins into their membranes. This suggests that an alternative mechanism must exist in bacterial cells. Fluman et al. looked at an existing data set that had measured how many ribosomes are found at different points along the length of mRNA molecules at any given time in the bacterium E. coli. If ribosomes are consistently found at specific sites in given mRNA molecules, it suggests that these are the sites where a pause in translation occurs. Specific short mRNA sequences‚Äîthat bind to a ribosome and hold it in place‚Äîare often found in these pause sites. These sequences are similar to another sequence, called the Shine‚ÄìDalgarno sequence that is often also found at the very start of an mRNA molecule, where it functions to recruit a ribosome and begin the translation process. Fluman et al. reveal that mRNAs of membrane proteins contained these similar sequences early on in their coding region. Some looked likely to pause the translation before the newly formed protein chain emerged from the ribosome, which could give the ribosome time to be targeted to the membrane. Other Shine‚ÄìDalgarno-like sequences were found slightly later on in the mRNA molecules for protein chains that span back-and-forth through the membrane several times. Fluman et al. show that slowing translation in this manner‚Äîwhich is different to that used by eukaryotes‚Äîhelps to ensure that membrane proteins are folded correctly in E. coli. Although these pauses occur frequently, mainly in the early stages of the translation of membrane proteins, there are many other translation pause sites that are known to exist in other mRNAs. The next challenge is to understand the function of these other pause sites, and how they work together with other mechanisms to regulate translating ribosomes inside cells.},

abstract = {Insertion of a nascent membrane protein segment by the translocon channel into the bilayer is naturally promoted by high segmental hydrophobicity, but its selection as a transmembrane (TM) segment is complicated by the diverse environments (aqueous vs lipidic) the protein encounters and by the fact that most TM segments contain a substantial amount (‚àº30{\%}) of polar residues, as required for protein structural stabilization and/or function. To examine the contributions of these factors systematically, we designed and synthesized a peptide library consisting of pairs of compositionally identical, but sequentially different, peptides with 19-residue core sequences varying (i) in Leu positioning (with five or seven Leu residues clustered into a contiguous ‚Äúblock‚Äù in the middle of the segment or ‚Äúscrambled‚Äù throughout the sequence) and (ii) in Ser content (0‚Äì6 residues). The library was analyzed by a combination of biophysical and biological techniques, including HPLC retention times, circular dichroism measurements of helicity in micelle and phospholipid bilayer media, and relative blue shifts in Trp fluorescence maxima, as well as by the extent of membrane insertion in a translocon-mediated assay using microsomal membranes from dog pancreas endoplasmic reticulum. We found that local blocks of high hydrophobicity heighten the translocon's propensity to insert moderately hydrophilic sequences, until a ‚Äúthreshold hydrophilicity‚Äù is surpassed whereby segments no longer insert even in the presence of Leu blocks. This study codifies the prerequisites of apolar/polar content and residue positioning that define nascent TM segments, illustrates the accuracy in their prediction, and highlights how a single disease-causing mutation can tip the balance toward anomalous translocation/insertion.},

abstract = {Previous studies have established that the folding, structure and function of membrane proteins are influenced by their lipid environments and that lipids can bind to specific sites, for example, in potassium channels. Fundamental questions remain however regarding the extent of membrane protein selectivity towards lipids. Here we report a mass spectrometry approach designed to determine the selectivity of lipid binding to membrane protein complexes. We investigate the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and aquaporin Z (AqpZ) and the ammonia channel (AmtB) from Escherichia coli, using ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS), which reports gas-phase collision cross-sections. We demonstrate that folded conformations of membrane protein complexes can exist in the gas phase. By resolving lipid-bound states, we then rank bound lipids on the basis of their ability to resist gas phase unfolding and thereby stabilize membrane protein structure. Lipids bind non-selectively and with high avidity to MscL, all imparting comparable stability; however, the highest-ranking lipid is phosphatidylinositol phosphate, in line with its proposed functional role in mechanosensation. AqpZ is also stabilized by many lipids, with cardiolipin imparting the most significant resistance to unfolding. Subsequently, through functional assays we show that cardiolipin modulates AqpZ function. Similar experiments identify AmtB as being highly selective for phosphatidylglycerol, prompting us to obtain an X-ray structure in this lipid membrane-like environment. The 2.3‚Äâ{\AA} resolution structure, when compared with others obtained without lipid bound, reveals distinct conformational changes that re-position AmtB residues to interact with the lipid bilayer. Our results demonstrate that resistance to unfolding correlates with specific lipid-binding events, enabling a distinction to be made between lipids that merely bind from those that modulate membrane protein structure and/or function. We anticipate that these findings will be important not only for defining the selectivity of membrane proteins towards lipids, but also for understanding the role of lipids in modulating protein function or drug binding.},

abstract = {Hydrophobic amino acids are abundant in transmembrane (TM) helices of membrane proteins. Charged residues are sparse, apparently due to the unfavorable energetic cost of partitioning charges into nonpolar phases. Nevertheless, conserved arginine residues within TM helices regulate vital functions, such as ion channel voltage gating and integrin receptor inactivation. The energetic cost of arginine in various positions along hydrophobic helices has been controversial. Potential of mean force (PMF) calculations from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations predict very large energetic penalties, while in vitro experiments with Sec61 translocons indicate much smaller penalties, even for arginine in the center of hydrophobic TM helices. Resolution of this conflict has proved difficult, because the in vitro assay utilizes the complex Sec61 translocon, while the PMF calculations rely on the choice of simulation system and reaction coordinate. Here we present the results of computational and experimental studies that permit direct comparison with the Sec61 translocon results. We find that the Sec61 translocon mediates less efficient membrane insertion of Arg-containing TM helices compared with our computational and experimental bilayer-insertion results. In the simulations, a combination of arginine snorkeling, bilayer deformation, and peptide tilting is sufficient to lower the penalty of Arg insertion to an extent such that a hydrophobic TM helix with a central Arg residue readily inserts into a model membrane. Less favorable insertion by the translocon may be due to the decreased fluidity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane compared with pure palmitoyloleoyl-phosphocholine (POPC). Nevertheless, our results provide an explanation for the differences between PMF- and experiment-based penalties for Arg burial.},

abstract = {Single pass transmembrane proteins make up almost half of the whole transmembrane proteome. Contacts between such bitopic transmembrane proteins are common, and oligomerization of their single transmembrane helix is involved in triggering and regulation of signal transduction across cell membranes. In several recent analyses the distribution of amino acids at helix-helix contact sides has been analyzed, and e.g. a preference of amino acids with small side chains has been identified. Here we select amino acids, amino acid pairings and amino acid motifs, which mediate strong interactions of single-span transmembrane $\alpha$-helices. Our analysis illustrates an architecture of TM helix dimers that is much more complex and diverse as might be expected from previous screens selecting homo-dimerizing TM helices. However, our findings are in excellent agreement with several previous computational analyses of existing transmembrane proteins and thus indicate that our screen nicely resembled the forces having guided evolution of transmembrane bundle structures. Furthermore, the results of this study indicate that helices do not per se have a strong propensity to interact via identical or highly similar helix surfaces, rather the geometries of two interacting helix surfaces ‚Äújust‚Äù have to match to tightly pack and thereby form a stable transmembrane helix dimer. Finally, while evolution of transmembrane helix-helix interactions most likely was a compromise between formation of thermodynamically stable contact surfaces and protein function, our results suggest that ‚Äústability‚Äù was a major driving force during the evolution of $\alpha$-helical transmembrane proteins.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES We examined whether kindergarten teachers' ratings of children's prosocial skills, an indicator of noncognitive ability at school entry, predict key adolescent and adult outcomes. Our goal was to determine unique associations over and above other important child, family, and contextual characteristics. METHODS Data came from the Fast Track study of low-socioeconomic status neighborhoods in 3 cities and 1 rural setting. We assessed associations between measured outcomes in kindergarten and outcomes 13 to 19 years later (1991-2000). Models included numerous control variables representing characteristics of the child, family, and context, enabling us to explore the unique contributions among predictors. RESULTS We found statistically significant associations between measured social-emotional skills in kindergarten and key young adult outcomes across multiple domains of education, employment, criminal activity, substance use, and mental health. CONCLUSIONS A kindergarten measure of social-emotional skills may be useful for assessing whether children are at risk for deficits in noncognitive skills later in life and, thus, help identify those in need of early intervention. These results demonstrate the relevance of noncognitive skills in development for personal and public health outcomes.},

abstract = {The great majority of helical membrane proteins are inserted co-translationally into the ER membrane through a continuous ribosome-translocon channel. The efficiency of membrane insertion depends on transmembrane (TM) helix amino acid composition, the helix length and the position of the amino acids within the helix. In this work, we conducted a computational analysis of the composition and location of amino acids in transmembrane helices found in membrane proteins of known structure to obtain an extensive set of designed polypeptide segments with naturally occurring amino acid distributions. Then, using an in vitro translation system in the presence of biological membranes, we experimentally validated our predictions by analyzing its membrane integration capacity. Coupled with known strategies to control membrane protein topology, these findings may pave the way to de novo membrane protein design. Transmembrane (TM) helices are the building blocks of the vast majority of integral membrane proteins. To perform their biological functions, integral membrane proteins must first insert their TM segments into the membrane in a helical conformation, and then acquire a defined three-dimensional structure by assembling their TM helices. In eukaryotic cells, the insertion and assembly of membrane proteins is mediated by the concerted action of a translating ribosome and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) translocon, which allows lateral integration of TM helices into the ER membrane 1},

Proper gp160 folding in the ER requires core glycosylation, disulfide-bond formation and proline isomerization. Signal-peptide cleavage occurs only late after gp160 chain termination and is dependent on folding of the soluble subunit gp120 to a near-native conformation. We here detail the mechanism by which co-translational signal-peptide cleavage is prevented. Conserved residues from the signal peptide and residues downstream of the canonical cleavage site form an extended alpha-helix in the ER membrane that covers the cleavage site, thus preventing cleavage. A point mutation in the signal peptide breaks the alpha helix allowing co-translational cleavage. We demonstrate that postponed cleavage of gp160 enhances functional folding of the molecule. The change to early cleavage results in decreased viral fitness compared to wild-type HIV.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We report a comprehensive analysis of the numbers, lengths and amino acid compositions of transmembrane helices in 235 high-resolution structures of integral membrane proteins. The properties of 1551 transmembrane helices in the structures were compared with those obtained by analysis of the same amino acid sequences using topology prediction tools. Explanations for the 81 (5.2{\%}) missing or additional transmembrane helices in the prediction results were identified. Main reasons for missing transmembrane helices were mis-identification of N-terminal signal peptides, breaks in $\alpha$-helix conformation or charged residues in the middle of transmembrane helices and transmembrane helices with unusual amino acid composition. The main reason for additional transmembrane helices was mis-identification of amphipathic helices, extramembrane helices or hairpin re-entrant loops. Transmembrane helix length had an overall median of 24 residues and an average of 24.9¬†¬±¬†7.0 residues and the most common length was 23 residues. The overall content of residues in transmembrane helices as a percentage of the full proteins had a median of 56.8{\%} and an average of 55.7¬†¬±¬†16.0{\%}. Amino acid composition was analysed for the full proteins, transmembrane helices and extramembrane regions. Individual proteins or types of proteins with transmembrane helices containing extremes in contents of individual amino acids or combinations of amino acids with similar physicochemical properties were identified and linked to structure and/or function. In addition to overall median and average values, all results were analysed for proteins originating from different types of organism (prokaryotic, eukaryotic, viral) and for subgroups of receptors, channels, transporters and others.},

@article{Baker2017,
abstract = {Background: Transmembrane helices (TMHs) frequently occur amongst protein architectures as means for proteins to attach to or embed into biological membranes. Physical constraints such as the membrane's hydrophobicity and electrostatic potential apply uniform requirements to TMHs and their flanking regions; consequently, they are mirrored in their sequence patterns (in addition to TMHs being a span of generally hydrophobic residues) on top of variations enforced by the specific protein's biological functions. Results: With statistics derived from a large body of protein sequences, we demonstrate that, in addition to the positive charge preference at the cytoplasmic inside (positive-inside rule), negatively charged residues preferentially occur or are even enriched at the non-cytoplasmic flank or, at least, they are suppressed at the cytoplasmic flank (negative-not-inside/negative-outside (NNI/NO) rule). As negative residues are generally rare within or near TMHs, the statistical significance is sensitive with regard to details of TMH alignment and residue frequency normalisation and also to dataset size; therefore, this trend was obscured in previous work. We observe variations amongst taxa as well as for organelles along the secretory pathway. The effect is most pronounced for TMHs from single-pass transmembrane (bitopic) proteins compared to those with multiple TMHs (polytopic proteins) and especially for the class of simple TMHs that evolved for the sole role as membrane anchors. Conclusions: The charged-residue flank bias is only one of the TMH sequence features with a role in the anchorage mechanisms, others apparently being the leucine intra-helix propensity skew towards the cytoplasmic side, tryptophan flanking as well as the cysteine and tyrosine inside preference. These observations will stimulate new prediction methods for TMHs and protein topology from a sequence as well as new engineering designs for artificial membrane proteins.},

abstract = {Tail-anchored (TA) protein synthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) represents a distinct and novel process that provides a paradigm for understanding post-translational membrane insertion in eukaryotes. The major route for delivering TA proteins to the ER requires both ATP and one or more cytosolic factors that facilitate efficient membrane insertion. Until recently, the identity of these cytosolic components was elusive, but two candidates have now been suggested to promote ATP-dependent TA protein integration. The first is the cytosolic chaperone complex of Hsp40/Hsc70, and the second is a novel ATPase denoted Asna-1 or TRC40. In this study we focus on the role of the Hsp40/Hsc70 complex in promoting TA protein biogenesis at the ER. We show that the membrane integration of most TA proteins is stimulated by Hsp40/Hsc70 when using purified components and a reconstituted system. In contrast, when both Hsp40/Hsc70 and Asna-1/TRC40 are provided as a complete system, small molecule inhibition of Hsp40/Hsc70 indicates that only a subset of TA proteins are obligatory clients for this chaperone-mediated delivery route. We show that the hydrophobicity of the TA region dictates whether a precursor is delivered to the ER via the Hsp40/Hsc70 or Asna-1/TRC40-dependent route, and we conclude that these distinct cytosolic ATPases are responsible for two different ATP-dependent pathways of TA protein biogenesis.},

abstract = {Glucose stimulation of islet beta-cell insulin secretion is initiated by membrane depolarization and an elevation in intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) from a combination of influx through depolarization-activated Ca2+ channels and intracellular Ca2+ store release. Prevention of Ca2+ store refilling with thapsigargin produced a sustained depolarization, leading to enhanced Ca2+ influx and an elevation in [Ca2+]i in 12 mM glucose. Depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by external EGTA reduced [Ca2+]i and also caused a long-lasting depolarization. In single beta-cells, external EGTA activated an inward current, the voltage range and kinetic properties of which differed from those of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. A novel pathway thus exists in beta-cells by which depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores results in the activation of an inward current that, by inducing depolarization, facilitates Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The physiological relevance of this pathway in the control of beta-cell function is indicated by the stimulation of insulin secretion by thapsigargin.},

These are often low-resolution structures that may only include the positions of C$\alpha$ atoms. We present a fast and efficient method to predict DNA-binding proteins from just the amino acid sequences and low-resolution, C$\alpha$-only protein models. The method uses the relative proportions of certain amino acids in the protein sequence, the asymmetry of the spatial distribution of certain other amino acids as well as the dipole moment of the molecule. These quantities are used in a linear formula, with coefficients derived from logistic regression performed on a training set, and DNA-binding is predicted based on whether the result is above a certain threshold. We show that the method is insensitive to errors in the atomic coordinates and provides correct predictions even on inaccurate protein models. We demonstrate that the method is capable of predicting proteins with novel binding site motifs and structures solved in an unbound state. The accuracy of our method is close to another, published method that uses all-atom structures, time-consuming calculations and information on conserved residues. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Accurate prediction of DNA-binding residues has become a problem of increasing importance in structural bioinformatics. Here, we presented DNABind, a novel hybrid algorithm for identifying these crucial residues by exploiting the complementarity between machine learning- and template-based methods. Our machine learning-based method was based on the probabilistic combination of a structure-based and a sequence-based predictor, both of which were implemented using support vector machines algorithms. The former included our well-designed structural features, such as solvent accessibility, local geometry, topological features, and relative positions, which can effectively quantify the difference between DNA-binding and nonbinding residues. The latter combined evolutionary conservation features with three other sequence attributes. Our template-based method depended on structural alignment and utilized the template structure from known protein-DNA complexes to infer DNA-binding residues. We showed that the template method had excellent performance when reliable templates were found for the query proteins but tended to be strongly influenced by the template quality as well as the conformational changes upon DNA binding. In contrast, the machine learning approach yielded better performance when high-quality templates were not available (about 1/3 cases in our dataset) or the query protein was subject to intensive transformation changes upon DNA binding. Our extensive experiments indicated that the hybrid approach can distinctly improve the performance of the individual methods for both bound and unbound structures. DNABind also significantly outperformed the state-of-art algorithms by around 10{\%} in terms of Matthews's correlation coefficient. The proposed methodology could also have wide application in various protein functional site annotations. DNABind is freely available at http://mleg.cse.sc.edu/DNABind/.

abstract = {The average globular protein contains 30{\%} alpha-helix, the most common type of secondary structure. Some amino acids occur more frequently in alpha-helices than others; this tendency is known as helix propensity. Here we derive a helix propensity scale for solvent-exposed residues in the middle positions of alpha-helices. The scale is based on measurements of helix propensity in 11 systems, including both proteins and peptides. Alanine has the highest helix propensity, and, excluding proline, glycine has the lowest, approximately 1 kcal/mol less favorable than alanine. Based on our analysis, the helix propensities of the amino acids are as follows (kcal/mol): Ala = 0, Leu = 0.21, Arg = 0.21, Met = 0.24, Lys = 0.26, Gln = 0.39, Glu = 0.40, Ile = 0.41, Trp = 0.49, Ser = 0.50, Tyr = 0. 53, Phe = 0.54, Val = 0.61, His = 0.61, Asn = 0.65, Thr = 0.66, Cys = 0.68, Asp = 0.69, and Gly = 1.},

Structural comparison of all OB-fold/nucleic acid complexes solved to date confirms the low degree of sequence similarity among members of this family while highlighting several structural sequence determinants common to most of these OB-folds. Loops connecting the secondary structural elements in the OB-fold core are extremely variable in length and in functional detail. However, certain features of ligand binding are conserved among OB-fold complexes, including the location of the binding surface, the polarity of the nucleic acid with respect to the OB-fold, and particular nucleic acid-protein interactions commonly used for recognition of single-stranded and unusually structured nucleic acids. Intriguingly, the observation of shared nucleic acid polarity may shed light on the longstanding question concerning OB-fold origins, indicating that it is unlikely that members of this family arose via convergent evolution.},

This is problematic, as many different data distributions can lead to the same bar or line graph. The full data may suggest different conclusions from the summary statistics. We recommend training investigators in data presentation, encouraging a more complete presentation of data, and changing journal editorial policies.

abstract = {Despite significant methodological advances in protein structure determination high-resolution structures of membrane proteins are still rare, leaving sequence-based predictions as the only option for exploring the structural variability of membrane proteins at large scale. Here, a new structural classification approach for $\alpha$-helical membrane proteins is introduced based on the similarity of predicted helix interaction patterns. Its application to proteins with known 3D structure showed that it is able to reliably detect structurally similar proteins even in the absence of any sequence similarity, reproducing the SCOP and CATH classifications with a sensitivity of 65{\%} at a specificity of 90{\%}. We applied the new approach to enhance our comprehensive structural classification of $\alpha$-helical membrane proteins (CAMPS), which is primarily based on sequence and topology similarity, in order to find protein clusters that describe the same fold in the absence of sequence similarity. The total of 151 helix architectures were delineated for proteins with more than four transmembrane segments. Interestingly, we observed that proteins with 8 and more transmembrane helices correspond to fewer different architectures than proteins with up to 7 helices, suggesting that in large membrane proteins the evolutionary tendency to re-use already available folds is more pronounced.},

In addition to collecting the experimentally determined topology data published in the last couple of years, we gathered topographies defined by the TMDET algorithm using 3D structures from the PDBTM. Results of global topology analysis of various organisms as well as topology data generated by high throughput techniques, like the sequential positions of N- or O-glycosylations were incorporated into the TOPDB database. Moreover, a new algorithm was developed to integrate scattered topology data from various publicly available databases and a new method was introduced to measure the reliability of predicted topologies. We show that reliability values highly correlate with the per protein topology accuracy of the utilized prediction method. Altogether, more than 52 000 new topology data and more than 2600 new transmembrane proteins have been collected since the last public release of the TOPDB database.},

In bacteria, gene transfer takes place by transformation, transduction, or conjugation and this review examines the roles of these gene transfer processes, between different bacteria, in a wide variety of ecological niches in the natural environment. This knowledge is necessary for our understanding of plasmid evolution and ecology, as well as for risk assessment. The rise and spread of multiple antibiotic resistance plasmids in medically important bacteria are consequences of intergeneric gene transfer coupled to the selective pressures posed by the increasing use and misuse of antibiotics in medicine and animal feedstuffs. Similarly, the evolution of degradative plasmids is a response to the increasing presence of xenobiotic pollutants in soil and water. Finally, our understanding of the role of horizontal gene transfer in the environment is essential for the evaluation of the possible consequences of the deliberate environmental release of natural or recombinant bacteria for agricultural and bioremediation purposes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Membrane proteins form key nodes in mediating the cell's interaction with the surroundings, which is one of the main reasons why the majority of drug targets are membrane proteins. RESULTS: Here we mined the human proteome and identified the membrane proteome subset using three prediction tools for alpha-helices: Phobius, TMHMM, and SOSUI. This dataset was reduced to a non-redundant set by aligning it to the human genome and then clustered with our own interactive implementation of the ISODATA algorithm. The genes were classified and each protein group was manually curated, virtually evaluating each sequence of the clusters, applying systematic comparisons with a range of databases and other resources. We identified 6,718 human membrane proteins and classified the majority of them into 234 families of which 151 belong to the three major functional groups: receptors (63 groups, 1,352 members), transporters (89 groups, 817 members) or enzymes (7 groups, 533 members). Also, 74 miscellaneous groups with 697 members were determined. Interestingly, we find that 41{\%} of the membrane proteins are singlets with no apparent affiliation or identity to any human protein family. Our results identify major differences between the human membrane proteome and the ones in unicellular organisms and we also show a strong bias towards certain membrane topologies for different functional classes: 77{\%} of all transporters have more than six helices while 60{\%} of proteins with an enzymatic function and 88{\%} receptors, that are not GPCRs, have only one single membrane spanning alpha-helix. Further, we have identified and characterized new gene families and novel members of existing families. CONCLUSION: Here we present the most detailed roadmap of gene numbers and families to our knowledge, which is an important step towards an overall classification of the entire human proteome. We estimate that 27{\%} of the total human proteome are alpha-helical transmembrane proteins and provide an extended classification together with in-depth investigations of the membrane proteome's functional, structural, and evolutionary features.},

abstract = {Although transmembrane proteins generally require membrane-embedded machinery for integration, a few can insert spontaneously into liposomes. Previously, we established that the tail-anchored (TA) protein cytochrome b(5) (b5) can posttranslationally translocate 28 residues downstream to its transmembrane domain (TMD) across protein-free bilayers (Brambillasca, S., M. Yabal, P. Soffientini, S. Stefanovic, M. Makarow, R.S. Hegde, and N. Borgese. 2005. EMBO J. 24:2533-2542). In the present study, we investigated the limits of this unassisted translocation and report that surprisingly long (85 residues) domains of different sequence and charge placed downstream of b5's TMD can posttranslationally translocate into mammalian microsomes and liposomes at nanomolar nucleotide concentrations. Furthermore, integration of these constructs occurred in vivo in translocon-defective yeast strains. Unassisted translocation was not unique to b5 but was also observed for another TA protein (protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B) whose TMD, like the one of b5, is only moderately hydrophobic. In contrast, more hydrophobic TMDs, like synaptobrevin's, were incapable of supporting unassisted integration, possibly because of their tendency to aggregate in aqueous solution. Our data resolve long-standing discrepancies on TA protein insertion and are relevant to membrane evolution, biogenesis, and physiology.},

The study of tail-anchored proteins has provided a paradigm for understanding the components and pathways that mediate post-translational biogenesis of membrane proteins at the endoplasmic reticulum.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Many important biological processes such as cell signaling, transport of membrane-impermeable molecules, cell-cell communication, cell recognition and cell adhesion are mediated by membrane proteins. Unfortunately, as these proteins are not water soluble, it is extremely hard to experimentally determine their structure. Therefore, improved methods for predicting the structure of these proteins are vital in biological research. In order to improve transmembrane topology prediction, we evaluate the combined use of both integrated signal peptide prediction and evolutionary information in a single algorithm. RESULTS: A new method (MEMSAT3) for predicting transmembrane protein topology from sequence profiles is described and benchmarked with full cross-validation on a standard data set of 184 transmembrane proteins. The method is found to predict both the correct topology and the locations of transmembrane segments for 80{\%} of the test set. This compares with accuracies of 62-72{\%} for other popular methods on the same benchmark. By using a second neural network specifically to discriminate transmembrane from globular proteins, a very low overall false positive rate (0.5{\%}) can also be achieved in detecting transmembrane proteins. AVAILABILITY: An implementation of the described method is available both as a web server (http://www.psipred.net) and as downloadable source code from http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/memsat.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Physicochemical properties are frequently analyzed to characterize protein-sequences of known and unknown function. Especially the hydrophobicity of amino acids is often used for structural prediction or for the detection of membrane associated or embedded $\beta$-sheets and $\alpha$-helices. For this purpose many scales classifying amino acids according to their physicochemical properties have been defined over the past decades. In parallel, several hydrophobicity parameters have been defined for calculation of peptide properties. We analyzed the performance of separating sequence pools using 98 hydrophobicity scales and five different hydrophobicity parameters, namely the overall hydrophobicity, the hydrophobic moment for detection of the $\alpha$-helical and $\beta$-sheet membrane segments, the alternating hydrophobicity and the exact {\ss}-strand score. RESULTS Most of the scales are capable of discriminating between transmembrane $\alpha$-helices and transmembrane $\beta$-sheets, but assignment of peptides to pools of soluble peptides of different secondary structures is not achieved at the same quality. The separation capacity as measure of the discrimination between different structural elements is best by using the five different hydrophobicity parameters, but addition of the alternating hydrophobicity does not provide a large benefit. An in silico evolutionary approach shows that scales have limitation in separation capacity with a maximal threshold of 0.6 in general. We observed that scales derived from the evolutionary approach performed best in separating the different peptide pools when values for arginine and tyrosine were largely distinct from the value of glutamate. Finally, the separation of secondary structure pools via hydrophobicity can be supported by specific detectable patterns of four amino acids. CONCLUSION It could be assumed that the quality of separation capacity of a certain scale depends on the spacing of the hydrophobicity value of certain amino acids. Irrespective of the wealth of hydrophobicity scales a scale separating all different kinds of secondary structures or between soluble and transmembrane peptides does not exist reflecting that properties other than hydrophobicity affect secondary structure formation as well. Nevertheless, application of hydrophobicity scales allows distinguishing between peptides with transmembrane $\alpha$-helices and $\beta$-sheets. Furthermore, the overall separation capacity score of 0.6 using different hydrophobicity parameters could be assisted by pattern search on the protein sequence level for specific peptides with a length of four amino acids.},

abstract = {Like all cellular proteins, membrane proteins are synthesized by ribosomes. But unlike their soluble counterparts, highly hydrophobic membrane proteins require auxiliary machineries to prevent aggregation in aqueous cellular compartments. The principal machine is the translocon, which works in concert with ribosomes to manage the orderly insertion of alpha-helical membrane proteins directly into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of eukaryotes or into the plasma membrane of bacteria. In the course of insertion, membrane proteins come into thermodynamic equilibrium with the lipid membrane, where physicochemical interactions determine the final three-dimensional structure. Much progress has been made during the past several years toward understanding the physical chemistry of membrane protein stability, the structure of the translocon machine, and the mechanisms by which the translocon selects and inserts transmembrane helices. We review this progress and consider the connection between the physical principles of membrane protein stability and translocon selection of transmembrane helices.},

@article{Chakrabarti2007,
abstract = {Although hydrophobic interaction is the main contributing factor to the stability of the protein fold, the specificity of the folding process depends on many directional interactions. An analysis has been carried out on the geometry of interaction between planar moieties of ten side chains (Phe, Tyr, Trp, His, Arg, Pro, Asp, Glu, Asn and Gln), the aromatic residues and the sulfide planes (of Met and cystine), and the aromatic residues and the peptide planes within the protein tertiary structures available in the Protein Data Bank. The occurrence of hydrogen bonds and other nonconventional interactions such as C-H‚ãØ$\pi$, C-H‚ãØO, electrophile-nucleophile interactions involving the planar moieties has been elucidated. The specific nature of the interactions constraints many of the residue pairs to occur with a fixed sequence difference, maintaining a sequential order, when located in secondary structural elements, such as $\alpha$-helices and $\beta$-turns. The importance of many of these interactions (for example, aromatic residues interacting with Pro or cystine sulfur atom) is revealed by the higher degree of conservation observed for them in protein structures and binding regions. The planar residues are well represented in the active sites, and the geometry of their interactions does not deviate from the general distribution. The geometrical relationship between interacting residues provides valuable insights into the process of protein folding and would be useful for the design of protein molecules and modulation of their binding properties. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Hydrophobic mismatch arises from a difference in the hydrophobic thickness of a lipid membrane and a transmembrane protein segment, and is thought to play an important role in the folding, stability and function of membrane proteins. We have investigated the possible adaptations that lipid bilayers and transmembrane $\alpha$-helices undergo in response to mismatch, using fully-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations totaling 1.4 $\mu$s. We have created 25 different tryptophan-alanine-leucine transmembrane $\alpha$-helical peptide systems, each composed of a hydrophobic alanine-leucine stretch, flanked by 1-4 tryptophan side chains, as well as the $\beta$-helical peptide dimer, gramicidin A. Membrane responses to mismatch include changes in local bilayer thickness and lipid order, varying systematically with peptide length. Adding more flanking tryptophan side chains led to an increase in bilayer thinning for negatively mismatched peptides, though it was also associated with a spreading of the bilayer interface. Peptide tilting, bending and stretching were systematic, with tilting dominating the responses, with values of up to {\~{}} 45 for the most positively mismatched peptides. Peptide responses were modulated by the number of tryptophan side chains due to their anchoring roles and distributions around the helices. Potential of mean force calculations for local membrane thickness changes, helix tilting, bending and stretching revealed that membrane deformation is the least energetically costly of all mismatch responses, except for positively mismatched peptides where helix tilting also contributes substantially. This comparison of energetic driving forces of mismatch responses allows for deeper insight into protein stability and conformational changes in lipid membranes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The factors contributing to the establishment of the steady state Golgi pH (pH(G)) were studied in intact and permeabilized mammalian cells by fluorescence ratio imaging. Retrograde transport of the nontoxic B subunit of verotoxin 1 was used to deliver pH-sensitive probes to the Golgi complex. To evaluate whether counter-ion permeability limited the activity of the electrogenic V-ATPase, we determined the concentration of K(+) in the lumen of the Golgi using a null point titration method. The [K(+)] inside the Golgi was found to be close to that of the cytosol, and increasing its permeability had no effect on pH(G). Moreover, the capacity of the endogenous counter-ion permeability exceeded the rate of H(+) pumping, implying that the potential across the Golgi membrane is negligible and has little influence on pH(G). The V-ATPase does not reach thermodynamic equilibrium nor does it seem to be allosterically inactivated at the steady state pH(G). In fact, active H(+) pumping was detectable even below the resting pH(G). A steady state pH was attained when the rate of pumping was matched by the passive backflux of H(+) (equivalents) or "leak." The nature of this leak pathway was investigated in detail. Neither vesicular traffic nor H(+)/cation antiporters or symporters were found to contribute to the net loss of H(+) from the Golgi. Instead, the leak was sensitive to voltage changes and was inhibited by Zn(2+), resembling the H(+) conductive pathway of the plasma membrane. We conclude that a balance between an endogenous leak, which includes a conductive component, and the H(+) pump determines the pH at which the Golgi lumen attains a steady state.},

We present a detailed analysis of TMHMM's performance, and show that it correctly predicts 97-98 {\%} of the transmembrane helices. Additionally, TMHMM can discriminate between soluble and membrane proteins with both specificity and sensitivity better than 99 {\%}, although the accuracy drops when signal peptides are present. This high degree of accuracy allowed us to predict reliably integral membrane proteins in a large collection of genomes. Based on these predictions, we estimate that 20-30 {\%} of all genes in most genomes encode membrane proteins, which is in agreement with previous estimates. We further discovered that proteins with N(in)-C(in) topologies are strongly preferred in all examined organisms, except Caenorhabditis elegans, where the large number of 7TM receptors increases the counts for N(out)-C(in) topologies. We discuss the possible relevance of this finding for our understanding of membrane protein assembly mechanisms. A TMHMM prediction service is available at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/.},

abstract = {Fluorescent probes for monitoring mitochondrial membrane potential are frequently used for assessing mitochondrial function, particularly in the context of cell fate determination in biological and biomedical research. However, valid interpretation of results obtained with such probes requires careful consideration of numerous controls, as well as possible effects of non-protonic charges on dye behavior. In this context, we provide an overview of some of the important technical considerations, controls, and parallel complementary assays that can be employed to help ensure appropriate interpretation of results, thus providing a practical usage guide for monitoring mitochondrial membrane potentials with cationic probes. In total, this review will help illustrate both the strengths and potential pitfalls of common mitochondrial membrane potential dyes, and highlight best-usage approaches for their efficacious application in life sciences research.},

abstract = {?? Helices are a basic unit of protein secondary structure and therefore the interaction between helices is crucial to understanding tertiary and higher-order folds. Comparing subtle variations in the structural and sequence motifs between membrane and soluble proteins sheds light on the different constraints faced by each environment and elucidates the complex puzzle of membrane protein folding. Here, we demonstrate that membrane and water-soluble helix pairs share a small number of similar folds with various interhelical distances. The composition of the residues that pack at the interface between corresponding motifs shows that hydrophobic residues tend to be more enriched in the water-soluble class of structures and small residues in the transmembrane class. The latter group facilitates packing via sidechain- and backbone-mediated hydrogen bonds within the low-dielectric membrane milieu. The helix-helix interactome space, with its associated sequence preferences and accompanying hydrogen-bonding patterns, should be useful for engineering, prediction, and design of protein structure.},

abstract = {Transmembrane helices are generally believed to insert into membranes based on their hydrophobicity. Nevertheless, there are important exceptions where polar residues have great functional importance, for instance the S4 helix of voltage-gated ion channels. It has been shown experimentally that insertion can be accomplished by hydrophobic counterbalance, predicting an arginine insertion cost of only 2.5 kcal/mol, compared with 14.9 kcal/mol in cyclohexane. Previous simulations of pure bilayers have produced values close to the pure hydrocarbon, which has lead to spirited discussion about the experimental conditions. Here, we have performed computer simulations of models better mimicking biological membranes by explicitly including protein helices at mass fractions from 15{\%} to 55{\%}, as well as an actual translocon. This has a striking effect on the solvation free energy of arginine. With some polar residues present, the solvation cost comes close to experimental observation at approximately 30{\%} mass fraction, and negligible at 40{\%}. In the presence of a translocon in the membrane, the cost of inserting arginine next to the lateral gate can be as low as 3-5 kcal/mol. The effect is mainly due to the extra helices making it easier to retain hydration water. These results offer a possible explanation for the discrepancy between the in vivo hydrophobicity scale and computer simulations and highlight the importance of the high protein contents in membranes. Although many membrane proteins are stable in pure bilayers, such simplified models might not be sufficiently accurate for insertion of polar or charged residues in biological membranes.},

Proteins of this family, named beta-CASP after the names of its representative members, possess specific features relative to those of other metallo-beta-lactamases, that are concentrated in the C-terminal part of the domain. In this study, using sensitive methods of sequence analysis, we identified highly conserved amino acids specific to the beta-CASP family, some of which were unidentified to date, that are predicted to play critical roles in the enzymatic function. The identification and characterisation of all the extant, detectable beta-CASP members within sequence databases and genome data also allowed us to unravel particular sequence features which are likely to be involved in substrate specificity, as well as to describe new but as yet uncharacterised members which may play critical roles in DNA and RNA metabolism.},

Asp and Glu residues cause a re-positioning of the C-terminal end of the transmembrane helix when placed in the one to two C-terminal turns but not when placed more centrally. Arg and Lys residues, in contrast, have little effect when placed in the two C-terminal turn but give rise to a more substantial shift in position when placed 9-11 residues from the helix end. We suggest that this difference between the effects of positively and negatively charged residues can be explained by the so-called snorkel effect, i.e. that the very long side-chains of Arg and Lys can reach up along the transmembrane helix to allow the terminal, charged moiety to reside in the lipid headgroup region while the Calpha of the residue is positioned well below the membrane/water interface.},

abstract = {Previous studies have established that the folding, structure and function of membrane proteins are influenced by their lipid environments and that lipids can bind to specific sites, for example, in potassium channels. Fundamental questions remain however regarding the extent of membrane protein selectivity towards lipids. Here we report a mass spectrometry approach designed to determine the selectivity of lipid binding to membrane protein complexes. We investigate the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and aquaporin Z (AqpZ) and the ammonia channel (AmtB) from Escherichia coli, using ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS), which reports gas-phase collision cross-sections. We demonstrate that folded conformations of membrane protein complexes can exist in the gas phase. By resolving lipid-bound states, we then rank bound lipids on the basis of their ability to resist gas phase unfolding and thereby stabilize membrane protein structure. Lipids bind non-selectively and with high avidity to MscL, all imparting comparable stability; however, the highest-ranking lipid is phosphatidylinositol phosphate, in line with its proposed functional role in mechanosensation. AqpZ is also stabilized by many lipids, with cardiolipin imparting the most significant resistance to unfolding. Subsequently, through functional assays we show that cardiolipin modulates AqpZ function. Similar experiments identify AmtB as being highly selective for phosphatidylglycerol, prompting us to obtain an X-ray structure in this lipid membrane-like environment. The 2.3‚Äâ{\AA} resolution structure, when compared with others obtained without lipid bound, reveals distinct conformational changes that re-position AmtB residues to interact with the lipid bilayer. Our results demonstrate that resistance to unfolding correlates with specific lipid-binding events, enabling a distinction to be made between lipids that merely bind from those that modulate membrane protein structure and/or function. We anticipate that these findings will be important not only for defining the selectivity of membrane proteins towards lipids, but also for understanding the role of lipids in modulating protein function or drug binding.},

@article{Krishnakumar2007,
abstract = {The ability of hydrophilic residues to shift the transverse position of transmembrane (TM) helices within bilayers was studied in model membrane vesicles. Transverse shifts were detected by fluorescence measurements of the membrane depth of a Trp residue at the center of a hydrophobic sequence. They were also estimated from the effective length of the TM-spanning sequence, derived from the stability of the TM configuration under conditions of negative hydrophobic mismatch. Hydrophilic residues (at the fifth position in a 21-residue hydrophobic sequence composed of alternating Leu and Ala residues and flanked on both ends by two Lys) induced transverse shifts that moved the hydrophilic residue closer to the membrane surface. At pH 7, the dependence of the extent of shift upon the identity of the hydrophilic residue increased in the order: L {\textless} G‚àºY‚àºT {\textless} R‚àºH {\textless} S {\textless} P {\textless} K {\textless} E‚àºQ {\textless} N {\textless} D. By varying pH, shifts with ionizable residues fully charged or uncharged were measured, and the extent of shift increased in the order: L {\textless} G‚àºY‚àºHo‚àºT {\textless} Eo‚àºR {\textless} S {\textless} P {\textless} K+{\textless} Q‚àºDo‚àºH+ {\textless} N‚àºE- {\textless} D-. The dependence of transverse shifts upon hydrophilic residue identity was consistent with the hypothesis that shift magnitude is largely controlled by the combination of side chain hydrophilicity, ionization state, and ability to position polar groups near the bilayer surface (snorkeling). Additional experiments showed that shift was also modulated by the position of the hydrophilic residue in the sequence and the hydrophobicity of the sequence moved out of the bilayer core upon shifting. Combined, these studies show that the insertion boundaries of TM helices are very sensitive to sequence, and can be altered even by weakly hydrophilic residues. Thus, many TM helices may have the capacity to exist in more than one transverse position. Knowledge of the magnitudes of transverse shifts induced by different hydrophilic residues should be useful for design of mutagenesis studies measuring the effect of transverse TM helix position upon function. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Advances in structure determination of membrane proteins enable analysis of the propensities of amino acids in extramembrane versus transmembrane locations to be performed on the basis of structure rather than of sequence and predicted topology. Using 29 available structures of integral membrane proteins with resolutions better than 4 {\AA} the distributions of amino acids in the transmembrane domains were calculated. The results were compared to analysis based on just the sequences of the same transmembrane $\alpha$-helices and significant differences were found. The distribution of residues between transmembrane $\alpha$-helices and $\beta$-strands was also compared. Large hydrophobic (Phe, Leu, Ile, Val) residues showed a clear preference for the protein surfaces facing the lipids for $\beta$-barrels, but in $\alpha$-helical proteins no such preference was seen, with these residues equally distributed between the interior and the surface of the protein. A notable exception to this was alanine, which showed a slight preference for the interior of $\alpha$-helical membrane proteins. Aromatic residues were found to follow saddle-like distributions preferring to be located in the lipid/water interfaces. The resultant 'aromatic belts' were spaced more closely for $\beta$-barrel than for $\alpha$-helical membrane proteins. Charged residues could be shown to generally avoid surfaces facing the bilayer although they were found to occur frequently in the transmembrane region of $\beta$-barrels. Indeed detailed comparison between $\alpha$-helical and $\beta$-barrel proteins showed many qualitative differences in residue distributions. This suggests that there may be subtle differences in the factors stabilising $\beta$-barrels in bacterial outer membranes and $\alpha$-helix bundles in all other membranes. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Integral membrane proteins are represented by 20-30{\%} of the eukaryotic genome and crucial for cellular functions including cell signaling, nutrient influx, toxin efflux, and maintenance of osmotic balance. Importantly, over 70{\%} of all drugs are targeted at membrane proteins. Because of their hydrophobicity, however, methods used to characterize the structure of soluble proteins, such as NMR and X-ray crystallography, are generally not suitable to the study of membrane proteins (1). The methods described in this chapter facilitate the identification and mapping of both extracellular and cytoplasmicsoluble domains of integral plasma membrane proteins using mass spectrometry. By combining a classical protease protection approach with recently developed proteomic methods, protease-accessible peptides (PAPs) are digested from proteins embedded in their native lipid environment and identified to characterize the topologies of integral membrane proteins.},

abstract = {The prediction of transmembrane (TM) helices plays an important role in the study of membrane proteins, given the relatively small number ([{\~{}}]0.5{\%} of the PDB) of high-resolution structures for such proteins. We used two datasets (one redundant and one non-redundant) of high-resolution structures of membrane proteins to evaluate and analyse TM helix prediction. The redundant (non-redundant) dataset contains structure of 434 (268) TM helices, from 112 (73) polypeptide chains. Of the 434 helices in the dataset, 20 may be classified as half-TM' as they are too short to span a lipid bilayer. We compared 13 TM helix prediction methods, evaluating each method using per segment, per residue and termini scores. Four methods consistently performed well: SPLIT4, TMHMM2, HMMTOP2 and TMAP. However, even the best methods were in error by, on average, about two turns of helix at the TM helix termini. The best and worst case predictions for individual proteins were analysed. In particular, the performance of the various methods and of a consensus prediction method, were compared for a number of proteins (e.g. SecY, ClC, KvAP) containing half-TM helices. The difficulties of predicting half-TM helices suggests that current prediction methods successfully embody the two-state model of membrane protein folding, but do not accommodate a third stage in which, e.g., short helices and re-entrant loops fold within a bundle of stable TM helices.},

abstract = {The Glut1 glucose transporter is a glycoprotein whose membrane topology has been verified by a number of experimental observations, all of which are consistent with a 12-transmembrane helix model originally based on hydrophobicity analysis. We used Glut1 as a model multispanning membrane protein to test the Charge Difference Hypothesis (Hartmann, E., Rapoport, T. A., and Lodish, H. F. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 86, 5786-5790), which asserts that the topology of a eucaryotic multispanning membrane protein is determined solely by the amino acid charge difference across the first transmembrane segment. The charge difference across the first transmembrane segment of Glut1 was progressively inverted in two independent series of mutants, one series in which only the number of positively charged amino acid residues in the two flanking domains was altered and the other in which only the number of negatively charged residues in the two flanking domains was changed. The results indicate that the charge difference across the first transmembrane segment does affect the topology of the protein, but that contrary to the hypothesis, it only dictates the orientation of the first transmembrane segment and the disposition of the amino terminus and the first linker domain. Charge inversion resulted in the formation of aberrant molecules in which either the first or second transmembrane segment failed to insert into the membrane. The topology of downstream regions of Glut1 was unaffected by charge inversion across the first transmembrane segment, indicating that downstream sequences are important in determining the local topological disposition of the molecule.},

abstract = {Transmembrane helical segments (TMs) can be classified into two groups of so-called 'simple' and 'complex' TMs. Whereas the first group represents mere hydrophobic anchors with an overrepresentation of aliphatic hydrophobic residues that are likely attributed to convergent evolution in many cases, the complex ones embody ancestral information and tend to have structural and functional roles beyond just membrane immersion. Hence, the sequence homology concept is not applicable on simple TMs. In practice, these simple TMs can attract statistically significant but evolutionarily unrelated hits during similarity searches (whether through BLAST- or HMM-based approaches). This is especially problematic for membrane proteins that contain both globular segments and TMs. As such, we have developed the transmembrane helix: simple or complex (TMSOC) webserver for the identification of simple and complex TMs. By masking simple TM segments in seed sequences prior to sequence similarity searches, the false-discovery rate decreases without sacrificing sensitivity. Therefore, TMSOC is a novel and necessary sequence analytic tool for both the experimentalists and the computational biology community working on membrane proteins.

We used large datasets from both fungi and vertebrates to perform a comprehensive comparison of the TMDs of proteins from different organelles. We find that TMDs are not generic but have organelle-specific properties with a dichotomy in TMD length between the early and late parts of the secretory pathway. In addition, TMDs from post-ER organelles show striking asymmetries in amino acid compositions across the bilayer that is linked to residue size and varies between organelles. The pervasive presence of organelle-specific features among the TMDs of a particular organelle has implications for TMD prediction, regulation of protein activity by location, and sorting of proteins and lipids in the secretory pathway. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

If this is indeed the case, it should be possible to predictably alter the topology of a polytopic protein by site-directed insertions and/or deletions of positively charged residues in critical locations.

@article{Bogdanov2014,
abstract = {Membrane protein folding and topogenesis are tuned to a given lipid profile since lipids and proteins have co-evolved to follow a set of interdependent rules governing final protein topological organization. Transmembrane domain (TMD) topology is determined via a dynamic process in which topogenic signals in the nascent protein are recognized and interpreted initially by the translocon followed by a given lipid profile in accordance with the Positive Inside Rule. The net zero charged phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine and other neutral lipids dampen the translocation potential of negatively charged residues in favor of the cytoplasmic retention potential of positively charged residues (Charge Balance Rule). This explains why positively charged residues are more potent topological signals than negatively charged residues. Dynamic changes in orientation of TMDs during or after membrane insertion are attributed to non-sequential cooperative and collective lipid-protein charge interactions as well as long-term interactions within a protein. The proportion of dual topological conformers of a membrane protein varies in a dose responsive manner with changes in the membrane lipid composition not only in vivo but also in vitro and therefore is determined by the membrane lipid composition. Switching between two opposite TMD topologies can occur in either direction in vivo and also in liposomes (designated as fliposomes) independent of any other cellular factors. Such lipid-dependent post-insertional reversibility of TMD orientation indicates a thermodynamically driven process that can occur at any time and in any cell membrane driven by changes in the lipid composition. This dynamic view of protein topological organization influenced by the lipid environment reveals previously unrecognized possibilities for cellular regulation and understanding of disease states resulting from mis-folded proteins.

abstract = {Recent advances in determination of the high-resolution structure of membrane proteins now enable analysis of the main features of amino acids in transmembrane (TM) segments in comparison with amino acids in water-soluble helices. In this work, we conducted a large-scale analysis of the prevalent locations of amino acids by using a data set of 170 structures of integral membrane proteins obtained from the MPtopo database and 930 structures of water-soluble helical proteins obtained from the protein data bank. Large hydrophobic amino acids (Leu, Val, Ile, and Phe) plus Gly were clearly prevalent in TM helices whereas polar amino acids (Glu, Lys, Asp, Arg, and Gln) were less frequent in this type of helix. The distribution of amino acids along TM helices was also examined. As expected, hydrophobic and slightly polar amino acids are commonly found in the hydrophobic core of the membrane whereas aromatic (Trp and Tyr), Pro, and the hydrophilic amino acids (Asn, His, and Gln) occur more frequently in the interface regions. Charged amino acids are also statistically prevalent outside the hydrophobic core of the membrane, and whereas acidic amino acids are frequently found at both cytoplasmic and extra-cytoplasmic interfaces, basic amino acids cluster at the cytoplasmic interface. These results strongly support the experimentally demonstrated biased distribution of positively charged amino acids (that is, the so-called the positive-inside rule) with structural data.},

For comparison, polarity profiles were also calculated for ten artificial lipid bilayers that have been previously studied by neutron and X-ray scattering. Estimated hydrophobic thicknesses are 30-31{\AA} for proteins from endoplasmic reticulum, thylakoid, and various bacterial plasma membranes, but differ for proteins from outer bacterial, inner mitochondrial and eukaryotic plasma membranes (23.9, 28.6 and 33.5{\AA}, respectively). Protein and lipid polarity parameters abruptly change in the lipid carbonyl zone that matches the calculated hydrophobic boundaries. Maxima of positively charged protein groups correspond to the location of lipid phosphates at 20-22{\AA} distances from the membrane center. Locations of Tyr atoms coincide with hydrophobic boundaries, while distributions maxima of Trp rings are shifted by 3-4{\AA} toward the membrane center. Distributions of Trp atoms indicate the presence of two 5-8{\AA}-wide midpolar regions with intermediate $\pi$* values within the hydrocarbon core, whose size and symmetry depend on the lipid composition of membrane leaflets. Midpolar regions are especially asymmetric in outer bacterial membranes and cell membranes of mesophilic but not hyperthermophilic archaebacteria, indicating the larger width of the central nonpolar region in the later case. In artificial lipid bilayers, midpolar regions are observed up to the level of acyl chain double bonds.},

abstract = {Zn(2+) plays essential roles in biology, and cells have adopted exquisite mechanisms for regulating steady-state Zn(2+) levels. Although much is known about total Zn(2+) in cells, very little is known about its subcellular distribution. Yet defining the location of Zn(2+) and how it changes with signaling events is essential for elucidating how cells regulate this essential ion. Here we create fluorescent sensors genetically targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi to monitor steady-state Zn(2+) levels as well as flux of Zn(2+) into and out of these organelles. These studies reveal that ER and Golgi contain a concentration of free Zn(2+) that is 100 times lower than the cytosol. Both organelles take up Zn(2+) when cytosolic levels are elevated, suggesting that the ER and Golgi can sequester elevated cytosolic Zn(2+) and thus have the potential to play a role in influencing Zn(2+) toxicity. ER Zn(2+) homeostasis is perturbed by small molecule antagonists of Ca(2+) homeostasis and ER Zn(2+) is released upon elevation of cytosolic Ca(2+) pointing to potential exchange of these two ions across the ER. This study provides direct evidence that Ca(2+) signaling can influence Zn(2+) homeostasis and vice versa, that Zn(2+) dynamics may modulate Ca(2+) signaling.},

abstract = {A computer program that progressively evaluates the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of a protein along its amino acid sequence has been devised. For this purpose, a hydropathy scale has been composed wherein the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of each of the 20 amino acid side-chains is taken into consideration. The scale is based on an amalgam of experimental observations derived from the literature. The program uses a moving-segment approach that continuously determines the average hydropathy within a segment of predetermined length as it advances through the sequence. The consecutive scores are plotted from the amino to the carboxy terminus. At the same time, a midpoint line is printed that corresponds to the grand average of the hydropathy of the amino acid compositions found in most of the sequenced proteins. In the case of soluble, globular proteins there is a remarkable correspondence between the interior portions of their sequence and the regions appearing on the hydrophobic side of the midpoint line, as well as the exterior portions and the regions on the hydrophilic side. The correlation was demonstrated by comparisons between the plotted values and known structures determined by crystallography. In the case of membrane-bound proteins, the portions of their sequences that are located within the lipid bilayer are also clearly delineated by large uninterrupted areas on the hydrophobic side of the midpoint line. As such, the membrane-spanning segments of these proteins can be identified by this procedure. Although the method is not unique and embodies principles that have long been appreciated, its simplicity and its graphic nature make it a very useful tool for the evaluation of protein structures. ?? 1982.},

By challenging the endoplasmic reticulum Sec61 translocon with an extensive set of designed polypeptide segments, we have determined the basic features of this code, including a 'biological' hydrophobicity scale. We find that membrane insertion depends strongly on the position of polar residues within transmembrane segments, adding a new dimension to the problem of predicting transmembrane helices from amino acid sequences.

Non-redundancy and intra-cluster homogeneity in UniRef were recently improved by adding a sequence length overlap threshold. Our hypothesis is that these improvements would enhance the speed and sensitivity of similarity searches and improve the consistency of annotation within clusters. RESULTS Intra-cluster molecular function consistency was examined by analysis of Gene Ontology terms. Results show that UniRef clusters bring together proteins of identical molecular function in more than 97{\%} of the clusters, implying that clusters are useful for annotation and can also be used to detect annotation inconsistencies. To examine coverage in similarity results, BLASTP searches against UniRef50 followed by expansion of the hit lists with cluster members demonstrated advantages compared with searches against UniProtKB sequences; the searches are concise (‚àº7 times shorter hit list before expansion), faster (‚àº6 times) and more sensitive in detection of remote similarities ({\textgreater}96{\%} recall at e-value {\textless}0.0001). Our results support the use of UniRef clusters as a comprehensive and scalable alternative to native sequence databases for similarity searches and reinforces its reliability for use in functional annotation.},

However, recent predictions suggest that many transmembrane helices (TMHs) in multispanning membrane proteins are not sufficiently hydrophobic to be recognized as such by the translocon. In this study, we have screened 16 marginally hydrophobic TMHs from membrane proteins of known three-dimensional structure. Indeed, most of these TMHs do not insert efficiently into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by themselves. To test if loops or TMHs immediately upstream or downstream of a marginally hydrophobic helix might influence the insertion efficiency, insertion of marginally hydrophobic helices was also studied in the presence of their neighboring loops and helices. The results show that flanking loops and nearest-neighbor TMHs are sufficient to ensure the insertion of many marginally hydrophobic helices. However, for at least two of the marginally hydrophobic helices, the local interactions are not enough, indicating that post-insertional rearrangements are involved in the folding of these proteins. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The average amino acid composition is different between the interfacial helices, the parts of the transmembrane helices located in the interface region, and the irregular structures.

abstract = {An inherent problem in transmembrane protein topology prediction and signal peptide prediction is the high similarity between the hydrophobic regions of a transmembrane helix and that of a signal peptide, leading to cross-reaction between the two types of predictions. To improve predictions further, it is therefore important to make a predictor that aims to discriminate between the two classes. In addition, topology information can be gained when successfully predicting a signal peptide leading a transmembrane protein since it dictates that the N terminus of the mature protein must be on the non-cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Here, we present Phobius, a combined transmembrane protein topology and signal peptide predictor. The predictor is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) that models the different sequence regions of a signal peptide and the different regions of a transmembrane protein in a series of interconnected states. Training was done on a newly assembled and curated dataset. Compared to TMHMM and SignalP, errors coming from cross-prediction between transmembrane segments and signal peptides were reduced substantially by Phobius. False classifications of signal peptides were reduced from 26.1{\%} to 3.9{\%} and false classifications of transmembrane helices were reduced from 19.0{\%} to 7.7{\%}. Phobius was applied to the proteomes of Homo sapiens and Escherichia coli. Here we also noted a drastic reduction of false classifications compared to TMHMM/SignalP, suggesting that Phobius is well suited for whole-genome annotation of signal peptides and transmembrane regions.

abstract = {Computational methods based on mathematically-defined measures of compositional complexity have been developed to distinguish globular and non-globular regions of protein sequences. Compact globular structures in protein molecules are shown to be determined by amino acid sequences of high informational complexity. Sequences of known crystal structure in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank differ only slightly from randomly shuffled sequences in the distribution of statistical properties such as local compositional complexity. In contrast, in the much larger body of deduced sequences in the SWISS-PROT database, approximately one quarter of the residues occur in segments of non-randomly low complexity and approximately half of the entries contain at least one such segment. Sequences of proteins with known, physicochemically-defined non-globular regions have been analyzed, including collagens, different classes of coiled-coil proteins, elastins, histones, non-histone proteins, mucins, proteoglycan core proteins and proteins containing long single solvent-exposed alpha-helices. The SEG algorithm provides an effective general method for partitioning the globular and non-globular regions of these sequences fully automatically. This method is also facilitating the discovery of new classes of long, non-globular sequence segments, as illustrated by the example of the human CAN gene product involved in tumor induction.},

The dihedral angles and hydrogen bonds of the helical sections that span the hydrophobic interior of the lipid bilayer have been investigated. The Ramachandran plot of protein channels and solute transporters exhibit a significant shift Delta (phi- and psi-angles) of Delta mean (+4.5 degrees and -5.4 degrees ), compared to a reference group of 151 alpha-helices of the same average length derived from water-soluble globular proteins. At the C-termini of transmembrane helices structural motifs equivalent to the Gly-caps of helices in globular proteins have been found, with two third of the transmembrane Gly-caps taking up a primary structure that is typically not found at helix termini exposed to a polar solvent.

@article{Wong2010,
abstract = {Large-scale genome sequencing gained general importance for life science because functional annotation of otherwise experimentally uncharacterized sequences is made possible by the theory of biomolecular sequence homology. Historically, the paradigm of similarity of protein sequences implying common structure, function and ancestry was generalized based on studies of globular domains. Having the same fold imposes strict conditions over the packing in the hydrophobic core requiring similarity of hydrophobic patterns. The implications of sequence similarity among non-globular protein segments have not been studied to the same extent; nevertheless, homology considerations are silently extended for them. This appears especially detrimental in the case of transmembrane helices (TMs) and signal peptides (SPs) where sequence similarity is necessarily a consequence of physical requirements rather than common ancestry. Thus, matching of SPs/TMs creates the illusion of matching hydrophobic cores. Therefore, inclusion of SPs/TMs into domain models can give rise to wrong annotations. More than 1001 domains among the 10,340 models of Pfam release 23 and 18 domains of SMART version 6 (out of 809) contain SP/TM regions. As expected, fragment-mode HMM searches generate promiscuous hits limited to solely the SP/TM part among clearly unrelated proteins. More worryingly, we show explicit examples that the scores of clearly false-positive hits, even in global-mode searches, can be elevated into the significance range just by matching the hydrophobic runs. In the PIR iProClass database v3.74 using conservative criteria, we find that at least between 2.1{\%} and 13.6{\%} of its annotated Pfam hits appear unjustified for a set of validated domain models. Thus, false-positive domain hits enforced by SP/TM regions can lead to dramatic annotation errors where the hit has nothing in common with the problematic domain model except the SP/TM region itself. We suggest a workflow of flagging problematic hits arising from SP/TM-containing models for critical reconsideration by annotation users.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sequence homology considerations widely used to transfer functional annotation to uncharacterized protein sequences require special precautions in the case of non-globular sequence segments including membrane-spanning stretches composed of non-polar residues. Simple, quantitative criteria are desirable for identifying transmembrane helices (TMs) that must be included into or should be excluded from start sequence segments in similarity searches aimed at finding distant homologues.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We found that there are two types of TMs in membrane-associated proteins. On the one hand, there are so-called simple TMs with elevated hydrophobicity, low sequence complexity and extraordinary enrichment in long aliphatic residues. They merely serve as membrane-anchoring device. In contrast, so-called complex TMs have lower hydrophobicity, higher sequence complexity and some functional residues. These TMs have additional roles besides membrane anchoring such as intra-membrane complex formation, ligand binding or a catalytic role. Simple and complex TMs can occur both in single- and multi-membrane-spanning proteins essentially in any type of topology. Whereas simple TMs have the potential to confuse searches for sequence homologues and to generate unrelated hits with seemingly convincing statistical significance, complex TMs contain essential evolutionary information.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: For extending the homology concept onto membrane proteins, we provide a necessary quantitative criterion to distinguish simple TMs (and a sufficient criterion for complex TMs) in query sequences prior to their usage in homology searches based on assessment of hydrophobicity and sequence complexity of the TM sequence segments.},

abstract = {$\alpha$-helical integral membrane proteins critically depend on the correct insertion of their transmembrane $\alpha$ helices into the lipid bilayer for proper folding, yet a surprisingly large fraction of the transmembrane $\alpha$ helices in multispanning integral membrane proteins are not sufficiently hydrophobic to insert into the target membrane by themselves. How can such marginally hydrophobic segments nevertheless form transmembrane helices in the folded structure? Here, we show that a transmembrane helix with a strong orientational preference (N cyt-C lum or N lum-C cyt) can both increase and decrease the hydrophobicity threshold for membrane insertion of a neighboring, marginally hydrophobic helix. This effect helps explain the " missing hydrophobicity" in polytopic membrane proteins. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

Twenty to 30{\%} of all ORFs are predicted to encode membrane proteins, with the larger genomes containing a higher fraction than the smaller ones. Although there is a general tendency that proteins with a smaller number of transmembrane segments are more prevalent than those with many, uni-cellular organisms appear to prefer proteins with 6 and 12 transmembrane segments, whereas Caenorhabditis elegans and Homo sapiens have a slight preference for proteins with seven transmembrane segments. In all organisms, there is a tendency that membrane proteins either have many transmembrane segments with short connecting loops or few transmembrane segments with large extra-membraneous domains. Membrane proteins from all organisms studied, except possibly the archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii, follow the so-called "positive-inside" rule; i.e., they tend to have a higher frequency of positively charged residues in cytoplasmic than in extra-cytoplasmic segments.},

abstract = {How complex cytoplasmic membrane proteins insert and fold into cellular membranes is not fully understood. One problem is the lack of suitable approaches that allow investigating the process by which polypeptides insert and fold into membranes. Here, we introduce a method to mechanically unfold and extract a single polytopic $\alpha$-helical membrane protein, the lactose permease (LacY), from a phospholipid membrane, transport the fully unfolded polypeptide to another membrane and insert and refold the polypeptide into the native structure. Insertion and refolding of LacY is facilitated by the transmembrane chaperone/insertase YidC in the absence of the SecYEG translocon. Insertion into the membrane occurs in a stepwise, stochastic manner employing multiple coexisting pathways to complete the folding process. We anticipate that our approach will provide new means of studying the insertion and folding of membrane proteins and to mechanically reconstitute membrane proteins at high spatial precision and stoichiometric control, thus allowing the functional programming of synthetic and biological membranes. KEYWORDS: Membrane protein insertion and folding, folding pathway, mechanical reconstitution, single-molecule force spectroscopy, YidC insertase, atomic force microscopy I n vivo the folding of cytoplasmic membrane proteins occurs in the context of vectorial translation of the freshly synthesized polypeptide, which exits the ribosome with its N-terminal end. 1‚àí6 However, translation is slow compared to folding, and it takes ribosomes between ‚àº5 s (bacteria) and ‚àº25 s (eukaryotes) to synthesize a 100 amino acid (aa) long protein. 7,8 Accordingly, the biogenesis of most polytopic membrane proteins depends critically on cotranslational insertion and folding in the cytoplasmic membrane, which is facilitated by ribosome‚àítranslocon-insertase complexes. 4‚àí6,9},

abstract = {The conserved SecYEG protein-conducting channel and the accessory proteins SecDF-YajC and YidC constitute the bacterial holo-translocon (HTL), capable of protein-secretion and membrane-protein insertion. By employing an integrative approach combining small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), low-resolution electron microscopy and biophysical analyses we determined the arrangement of the proteins and lipids within the super-complex. The results guided the placement of X-ray structures of individual HTL components and allowed the proposal of a model of the functional translocon. Their arrangement around a central lipid-containing pool conveys an unexpected, but compelling mechanism for membrane-protein insertion. The periplasmic domains of YidC and SecD are poised at the protein-channel exit-site of SecY, presumably to aid the emergence of translocating polypeptides. The SecY lateral gate for membrane-insertion is adjacent to the membrane 'insertase' YidC. Absolute-scale SANS employing a novel contrast-match-point analysis revealed a dynamic complex adopting open and compact configurations around an adaptable central lipid-filled chamber, wherein polytopic membrane-proteins could fold, sheltered from aggregation and proteolysis. The hetero-trimeric Sec protein-conducting channel translocates integral inner membrane proteins and secretory proteins into or across the membrane 1,2 . Doung and Wickner discovered that in bacteria additional factors associate with this complex to facilitate efficient protein translocation and named the supercomplex " preprotein translocase holoenzyme " 3 .

Further study, however, was impeded by the lack of means to produce holo-translocon in the quality and quantity required for its biochemical and structural characterization.

abstract = {Interaction between transmembrane helices often determines biological activity of membrane proteins. Bitopic proteins, a broad subclass of membrane proteins, form dimers containing two membrane-spanning helices. Some aspects of their structure-function relationship cannot be fully understood without considering the protein-lipid interaction, which can determine the protein conformational ensemble. Experimental and computer modeling data concerning transmembrane parts of bitopic proteins are reviewed in the present paper. They highlight the importance of lipid-protein interactions and resolve certain paradoxes in the behavior of such proteins. Besides, some properties of membrane organization provided a clue to understanding of allosteric interactions between distant parts of proteins. Interactions of these kinds appear to underlie a signaling mechanism, which could be widely employed in the functioning of many membrane proteins. Treatment of membrane proteins as parts of integrated fine-tuned proteolipid system promises new insights into biological function mechanisms and approaches to drug design.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors. The FEBS Journal published by John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd on behalf of Federation of European Biochemical Societies.Single-pass transmembrane receptors are involved in essential processes of both physiological and pathological nature and represent more than 1300 proteins in the human genome. Despite the high biological relevance of these receptors, the mechanisms of the signal transductions they facilitate are incompletely understood. One major obstacle is the lack of structures of the transmembrane domains that connect the extracellular ligand-binding domains to the intracellular signaling platforms. Over a period of almost 20¬†years since the first structure was reported, only 21 of these receptors have become represented by a transmembrane domain structure. This scarceness stands in strong contrast to the significance of these transmembrane $\alpha$-helices for receptor functionality. In this review, we explore the properties and qualities of the current set of structures, as well as the methodological difficulties associated with their characterization and the challenges left to be overcome. Without an increased and focused effort to bring this class of proteins on par with the remaining membrane protein field, a serious lag in their biological understanding looms. Design of pharmaceutical agents, prediction of mutational affects in relation to disease, and deciphering of functional mechanisms require high-resolution structural information, especially when dealing with a domain carrying so much functionality in so few residues.},

@article{Woese1990,
abstract = {Molecular structures and sequences are generally more revealing of evolutionary relationships than are classical phenotypes (particularly so among microorganisms). Consequently, the basis for the definition of taxa has progressively shifted from the organismal to the cellular to the molecular level. Molecular comparisons show that life on this planet divides into three primary groupings, commonly known as the eubacteria, the archaebacteria, and the eukaryotes. The three are very dissimilar, the differences that separate them being of a more profound nature than the differences that separate typical kingdoms, such as animals and plants. Unfortunately, neither of the conventionally accepted views of the natural relationships among living systems--i.e., the five-kingdom taxonomy or the eukaryote-prokaryote dichotomy--reflects this primary tripartite division of the living world. To remedy this situation we propose that a formal system of organisms be established in which above the level of kingdom there exists a new taxon called a "domain." Life on this planet would then be seen as comprising three domains, the Bacteria, the Archaea, and the Eucarya, each containing two or more kingdoms. (The Eucarya, for example, contain Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, and a number of others yet to be defined). Although taxonomic structure within the Bacteria and Eucarya is not treated herein, Archaea is formally subdivided into the two kingdoms Euryarchaeota (encompassing the methanogens and their phenotypically diverse relatives) and Crenarchaeota (comprising the relatively tight clustering of extremely thermophilic archaebacteria, whose general phenotype appears to resemble most the ancestral phenotype of the Archaea.},

@article{Hamming,
abstract = {Prologue. It is evident from the title that this is a philosophical discussion. I shall not apologize for the philosophy, though I am well aware that most scientists, engineers, and mathematicians have little regard for it; instead, I shall give this short prologue to justify the approach. Man, so far as we know, has always wondered about himself, the world around him, and what life is all about. We have many myths from the past that tell how and why God, or the gods, made man and the universe. These I shall call theological explanations. They have one principal characteristic in common-there is little point in asking why things are the way they are, since we are given mainly a description of the creation as the gods chose to do it. Philosophy started when man began to wonder about the world outside of this theological framework. An early example is the description by the philosophers that the world is made of earth, fire, water, and air. No doubt they were told at the time that the gods made things that way and to stop worrying about it. From these early attempts to explain things slowly came philosophy as well as our present science. Not that science explains "why" things are as they are-gravitation does not explain why things fall-but science gives so many details of "how" that we have the feeling we understand "why." Let us be clear about this point; it is by the sea of interrelated details that science seems to say "why" the universe is as it is. Our main tool for carrying out the long chains of tight reasoning required by science is mathematics. Indeed, mathematics might be defined as being the mental tool designed for this purpose. Many people through the ages have asked the question I am effectively asking in the title, "Why is mathematics so unreasonably effective?" In asking this we are merely looking more at the logical side and less at the material side of what the universe is and how it works. Mathematicians working in the foundations of mathematics are concerned mainly with the self-consistency and limitations of the system. They seem not to concern themselves with why the world apparently admits of a logical explanation. In a sense I am in the position of the early Greek philosophers who wondered about the material side, and my answers on the logical side are probably not much better than theirs were in their time. But we must begin somewhere and sometime to explain the phenomenon that the world seems to be organized in a logical pattern that parallels much of mathematics, that mathematics is the language of science and engineering. Once I had organized the main outline, I had then to consider how best to communicate my ideas and opinions to others. Experience shows that I am not always successful in this matter. It finally occurred to me that the following preliminary.remarks would help. In some respects this discussion is highly theoretical. I have to mention, at least slightly, various theories of the general activity called mathematics, as well as touch on selected parts of it. Furthermore, there are various theories of applications. Thus, to some extent, this leads to a theory of theories. What may surprise you is that I shall take the experimentalist's approach in discussing things. Never mind what the theories are supposed to be, or what you think they should be, or even what the experts in the field assert they are; let us take the scientific attitude and look at what they are. I am well aware that much of what I say, especially about the nature Richard W. Hamming received his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois in 1942 and has had a distinguished career in computing, mainly at the Bell Telephone Laboratories. He has also done part-time teaching. Since 1976 he has been on the faculty of the Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California, in the Computer Science Department. He is a past president of the Association for Computing Machinery and received its Turing prize. He has published six books and many articles.

abstract = { DURING World War II some of the research in theoretical physics
 and engineering, which was important both for attack and defence,
 required vast calculations to be carried out. The delay involved in
 doing these with pencil and paper would have been a serious drawback;
 but the difficulty was overcome by means of electronic calculating
 machines, which could solve in a matter of hours mathematical
 equations that would otherwise have taken months to work out.
 Such machines had to be able (a) to be fed with information, (b) to
 store in some form the results of their preliminary calculations, (c) to
 make use of these results appropriately at the right time, i.e. to select
 from their 'files', and (d) to report their final results. There is an
 obvious analogy between such powers and those of the intellect-
 working out, storing, recalling, selecting, and communicating.
 Indeed it is possible to design a machine to play chess without breaking
 the rules and even to make ' sound' moves, once it has been provided
 with some criterion of evaluation of moves. If this were all, however,
 the analogy between the machine and the brain or mind (we need not
 here be precise which) would hardly be striking. What is important

To examine the composition of the native lipid environment in the vicinity of the SecYEG complex and its impact on translocation activity, styrene-maleic acid lipid particles (SMALPs) were used to extract SecYEG with its lipid environment directly from native Escherichia coli membranes without the use of detergents. This allowed the co-extraction of SecYEG in complex with SecA, but not with SecDFyajC or YidC. Lipid analysis of the SecYEG-SMALPs revealed an enrichment of negatively charged lipids in the vicinity of SecYEG, which in detergent assisted reconstitution of the Sec translocase are crucial for the translocation activity. Such lipid enrichment was not found with separately extracted SecDFyajC or YidC, which demonstrates a specific interaction between SecYEG and negatively charged lipids.},

Subsequently, they are targeted to the Sec translocase in the cytoplasmic membrane, a multimeric membrane protein complex composed of a highly conserved protein-conducting channel, SecYEG, and a peripherally bound ribosome or ATP-dependent motor protein SecA. The Sec translocase mediates the translocation of proteins across the membrane and the insertion of membrane proteins into the cytoplasmic membrane. Translocation requires the energy sources of ATP and the proton motive force (PMF) while the membrane protein insertion is coupled to polypeptide chain elongation at the ribosome. This review summarizes the present knowledge of the mechanism and structure of the Sec translocase, with a special emphasis on unr...},

abstract = {Oligomerization of membrane proteins in response to lipid binding has a critical role in many cell-signalling pathways but is often difficult to define or predict. Here we report the development of a mass spectrometry platform to determine simultaneously the presence of interfacial lipids and oligomeric stability and to uncover how lipids act as key regulators of membrane-protein association. Evaluation of oligomeric strength for a dataset of 125 $\alpha$-helical oligomeric membrane proteins reveals an absence of interfacial lipids in the mass spectra of 12 membrane proteins with high oligomeric stability. For the bacterial homologue of the eukaryotic biogenic transporters (LeuT, one of the proteins with the lowest oligomeric stability), we found a precise cohort of lipids within the dimer interface. Delipidation, mutation of lipid-binding sites or expression in cardiolipin-deficient Escherichia coli abrogated dimer formation. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed that cardiolipin acts as a bidentate ligand, bridging across subunits. Subsequently, we show that for the Vibrio splendidus sugar transporter SemiSWEET, another protein with low oligomeric stability, cardiolipin shifts the equilibrium from monomer to functional dimer. We hypothesized that lipids are essential for dimerization of the Na(+)/H(+) antiporter NhaA from E. coli, which has the lowest oligomeric strength, but not for the substantially more stable homologous Thermus thermophilus protein NapA. We found that lipid binding is obligatory for dimerization of NhaA, whereas NapA has adapted to form an interface that is stable without lipids. Overall, by correlating interfacial strength with the presence of interfacial lipids, we provide a rationale for understanding the role of lipids in both transient and stable interactions within a range of $\alpha$-helical membrane proteins, including G-protein-coupled receptors.},

Fifteen oligosaccharides are linked to threonine/serine residues via O-glycosidic bonds, and one more complex unit is attached to asparagine. The location of each of these oligosaccharides and the complete amino-acid sequence of this molecular have been determined by Edman degradation techniques. Glycophorin appears to be organized into three distinct "domains" on the basis of the locations of glycosylated amino acids and the clustering of residues of similar type. These include (i) a glycosylated segment composed of approximately 64 residues from the NH2-terminus, (ii) a "hydrophobic" segment of approximately 32 nonpolar residues, and (iii) a COOH-terminal segment, composed of approximately 35 residues, which has an unusual concentration of hydrophilic amino acids. This unique structure is consistent with the earlier suggestions that glycophorin is one of the major "intrinsic" membrane proteins which has a transmembrane orientation.},

The evolutionary origins of such attraction are not well understood. Accordingly, this paper proposed a theoretical framework where, during the period of human evolution, same-sex attractions in women were under positive selection. The source of positive selection has been male preferences for opposite-sex sex partners who experi-enced same-sex attractions. This theoretical framework was used to generate four predictions that were tested in two online studies which employed a total of 1509 heterosexual participants. It was found that heterosexual women did not desire partners who experienced same-sex attractions, but a considerable proportion of hetero-sexual men desired partners who experienced same-sex attractions. In addition, it was found that men were more sexually excited than women by the same-sex infidelity of their partners, and they desired more than women, their opposite-sex partners to have sex with same-sex individuals. Finally, participants' preferences were contingent on the seriousness of the relationships, with same-sex attraction to be preferred more in short-term than in a long-term partner. These findings were employed in understanding the evolutionary origins of same-sex attraction in women.},

abstract = {One contribution of 12 to a theme issue 'The bacterial cell envelope'. The structure of the first protein-conducting channel was determined more than a decade ago. Today, we are still puzzled by the outstanding problem of protein translocation‚Äîthe dynamic mechanism underlying the consignment of pro-teins across and into membranes. This review is an attempt to summarize and understand the energy transducing capabilities of protein-translocating machines, with emphasis on bacterial systems: how polypeptides make head-way against the lipid bilayer and how the process is coupled to the free energy associated with ATP hydrolysis and the transmembrane protein motive force. In order to explore how cargo is driven across the membrane, the known structures of the protein-translocation machines are set out against the background of the historic literature, and in the light of experiments con-ducted in their wake. The paper will focus on the bacterial general secretory (Sec) pathway (SecY-complex), and its eukaryotic counterpart (Sec61-complex), which ferry proteins across the membrane in an unfolded state, as well as the unrelated Tat system that assembles bespoke channels for the export of folded proteins. 1. Background Energy conservation through chemiosmosis and oxidative phosphorylation pro-vides the means to control the chemistry and dynamics of the cell. The free energy available from ATP hydrolysis and electrochemical gradients is coupled to the transport of biochemical metabolites and polymers across membranes according to the specific requirements of the cell: for import, export or between internal com-partments in eukaryotic cells. Proteins, for instance, often need to be transported following (or during) their synthesis in the cytosol across and/or into biological membranes for secretion, membrane insertion and import into organelles such as chloroplasts and mitochondria. In every living cell, protein secretion and mem-brane protein insertion occurs via the general protein secretion, or Sec, machinery. This is the case at the plasma membranes of bacteria and archaea, the chloroplast thylakoid membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotes. Between one-quarter to a third of all proteins either cross or insert into biologi-cal membranes [1,2]; most of these use the Sec protein machinery, which transports proteins in an unfolded state. The Sec protein-conducting channel is formed by a hetero-trimeric membrane protein complex: the SecY-complex in bacteria, archaea and plant plastids, and Sec61 in eukaryotes. The channel acts either co-translation-ally, engaging translating ribosomes and forming a ribosome nascent chain complex (RNC), or post-translationally, which involves the binding of specialized energy-transducing factors. The co-translational system is the primary pathway for protein secretion in eukaryokes [3‚Äì5], and for membrane protein insertion in all domains of life [6]. The post-translational pathway, meanwhile, is used mainly by prokaryotes for protein secretion [7], although an increasing number of eukaryotic proteins have also been shown to follow this pathway [8,9]. Both types of secretion are initiated when the N-terminal region of a pre-protein is targeted to the SecY/Sec61 complex at the plasma (prokaryotes) or},

abstract = {This mini-review presents recent advances in the regulation of the membrane transbilayer movement (or flip-flop) of diacylglycerol (DAG), a key intermediate in lipid metabolism and a second messenger in lipid-mediated signaling. Despite progresses in lipid biophysics and imaging, little is known about the DAG dynamics across the two leaflets of the plasma membrane in living cells. Previous model membrane studies with DAG analogs demonstrated their fast flip-flop suggesting that DAG is evenly distributed between the two leaflets of the plasma membrane. However, recent molecular dynamics simulations indicate that DAG transbilayer movement depends on the lipid environment surrounding the lipid, i.e. DAG flips more slowly across a more ordered ‚Äúlipid raft-like‚Äù bilayer (enriched in sphingomyelin/cholesterol) than across a more fluid bilayer (composed of unsaturated glycerophospholipids). Furthermore using the yellow fluorescent protein-tagged C1AB domain from protein kinase C-$\gamma$ (EYFP-C1AB) that selectively binds DAG, we recently proved that the sphingomyelin (SM) content in the plasma membrane outer leaflet regulates DAG transbilayer movement in Madin‚ÄìDarby canine kidney cells treated with bacterial phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C. The dose-dependent inhibition of DAG flip-flop by SM could be reproduced in model membranes using fluorescent short chain DAG analog. Regulation of DAG transbilayer movement by the outer leaflet SM content is expected to modify the downstream recruitment of C1-domain containing effectors, thus bringing new insights on the role of DAG dynamics in cell pathophysiology.},

We attempt here to reconcile the results of the two approaches. We first present MD simulations of guanidinium groups alone in lipid bilayers, and then, to mimic the molecular biology experiments, we present simulations of hydrophobic helices containing single Arg residues at different positions along the helix. We discuss the simulation results in the context of molecular biology results and show that the energetic discrepancy is reduced, but not eliminated, by considering free energy differences between Arg at the interface and at the center of the model helices. The reduction occurs because Arg snorkeling to the interface prevents Arg from residing in the bilayer center where the energetic cost of desolvation is highest. We then show that the problem with MD simulations is that they measure water-to-bilayer free energies, whereas the molecular biology experiments measure the energetics of partitioning from translocon to bilayer, which raises the fundamental question of the relationship between water-to-bilayer and water-to-translocon partitioning. We present two thermodynamic scenarios as a foundation for reconciliation of the simulation and molecular biology results. The simplest scenario is that translocon-to-bilayer partitioning is independent of water-to-bilayer partitioning; there is no thermodynamic cycle connecting the two paths.},

abstract = {Soluble amphiphiles, or detergents, are known to produce a number of structural and dynamic effects on membranes, even at concentrations below those causing membrane solubilization (i.e. in the so-called stage I of detergent-membrane interaction). The main subsolubilizing detergent effects on membranes are transmembrane lipid motion (flip-flop), breakdown of the membrane permeability barrier (leakage), and vesicle lysis/reassembly. For a proper understanding of membrane solubilization by detergents, it is important to assess whether the various effects seen at subsolubilizing surfactant concentrations occur independently from each other or are interconnected by cause-effect relationships so that they can be interpreted as necessary steps in the overall process of solubilization. To answer this question, we have explored the three above-mentioned effects (i.e., flip-flop, leakage, and lysis/reassembly) apart from solubilization in model (large unilamellar vesicles) and cell (erythrocyte) membranes. Five structurally different surfactants, namely, chlorpromazine, imipramine, Triton X-100, sodium dodecylsulfate, and sodium deoxycholate have been used. Each of them behaves in a unique way. Our results reveal that lipid flip-flop, vesicle leakage, and vesicle lysis/reassembly occur independently between them and with respect to bilayer solubilization so that they cannot be considered to be necessary parts of a higher-order unified process of membrane solubilization by detergents.},

abstract = {The soluble and membrane-bound forms of the syn-thetic rat cytochrome b g gene have been expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In order to examine the topology and function of the COOH-terminal mem-brane binding domain of cytochrome bs, mutants have been constructed, expressed, purified, and partially characterized. Pro-115 is located in the middle of the putative a-helical membrane-anchoring domain of cy-tochrome bg and has been hypothesized to give rise to either a hairpin-like loop or =26O kink in the helix, depending on whether it exists, respectively, in the cis or trans configuration. The Pro-115 + Ala mutant, which is expected to have a straight transmembrane helix, inserted normally into the endoplasmic reticu-lum and exhibited wild type levels of activity in yeast microsomes and in vitro in the cytochrome P-450 mixed function oxidation system. Since a hairpin struc-ture does not appear to be essential, it is likely that the membrane binding domain of cytochrome b g spans the membrane. Characterization of the truncated cytochrome b g molecule, Pro-115 + Stop, lacking 19 amino acids at the COOH terminus indicates that the distal part of the membrane binding domain of cytochrome bs is neces-sary for in vivo binding to the endoplasmic reticulum and for functioning with its membrane-associated elec-tron transfer partners. Replacement of Ser-104 to Met-125, the putative membrane-anchoring domain of cytochrome bg, with 22 leucine residues results in a protein which targets to the endoplasmic reticulum but the extent of its re-duction is only 50{\%} of that of the wild type in yeast microsomes.

Here we use evolutionary conservation analysis to build a model structure of NHE9 based on the crystal structure of bacterial NhaA and use it to screen autism-associated variants in the human population first by phenotype complementation in yeast, followed by functional analysis in primary cortical astrocytes from mouse. NHE9-GFP localizes to recycling endosomes, where it significantly alkalinizes luminal pH, elevates uptake of transferrin and the neurotransmitter glutamate, and stabilizes surface expression of transferrin receptor and GLAST transporter. In contrast, autism-associated variants L236S, S438P and V176I lack function in astrocytes. Thus, we establish a neurobiological cell model of a candidate gene in autism. Loss-of-function mutations in NHE9 may contribute to autistic phenotype by modulating synaptic membrane protein expression and neurotransmitter clearance.},

abstract = {Many secretory proteins are targeted by signal sequences to a protein-conducting channel, formed by prokaryotic SecY or eukaryotic Sec61 complexes, and are translocated across the membrane during their synthesis. Crystal structures of the inactive channel show that the SecY subunit of the heterotrimeric complex consists of two halves that form an hourglass-shaped pore with a constriction in the middle of the membrane and a lateral gate that faces the lipid phase. The closed channel has an empty cytoplasmic funnel and an extracellular funnel that is filled with a small helical domain, called the plug. During initiation of translocation, a ribosome-nascent chain complex binds to the SecY (or Sec61) complex, resulting in insertion of the nascent chain. However, the mechanism of channel opening during translocation is unclear. Here we have addressed this question by determining structures of inactive and active ribosome-channel complexes with cryo-electron microscopy. Non-translating ribosome-SecY channel complexes derived from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii or Escherichia coli show the channel in its closed state, and indicate that ribosome binding per se causes only minor changes. The structure of an active E. coli ribosome-channel complex demonstrates that the nascent chain opens the channel, causing mostly rigid body movements of the amino- and carboxy-terminal halves of SecY. In this early translocation intermediate, the polypeptide inserts as a loop into the SecY channel with the hydrophobic signal sequence intercalated into the open lateral gate. The nascent chain also forms a loop on the cytoplasmic surface of SecY rather than entering the channel directly.},

We used a high-performance, reconstituted in vitro translation system to investigate the folding of a small five-helix protein domain-the N-terminal domain of Escherichia coli N5-glutamine methyltransferase HemK-in real time. Our observations show that cotranslational folding of the protein, which folds autonomously and rapidly in solution, proceeds through a compact, non-native conformation that forms within the peptide tunnel of the ribosome. The compact state rearranges into a native-like structure immediately after the full domain sequence has emerged from the ribosome. Both folding transitions are rate-limited by translation, allowing for quasi-equilibrium sampling of the conformational space restricted by the ribosome. Cotranslational folding may be typical of small, intrinsically rapidly folding protein domains.},

Here, we address the question whether the tilt is an intrinsic property of the TMH in question or if it is imparted on the TMH during folding of the protein. Using a glycosylation mapping technique, we show that four highly tilted helices found in multi-spanning membrane proteins all have much shorter membrane-embedded segments when inserted by themselves into the membrane than seen in the high-resolution structures. This suggests that tilting can be induced by tertiary packing interactions within the protein, subsequent to the initial membrane-insertion step. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The thermodynamic stability of proteins is typically measured at high denaturant concentrations and then extrapolated back to zero denaturant conditions to obtain unfolding free energies under native conditions. For membrane proteins, the extrapolations are fraught with considerable uncertainty as the denaturants may have complex effects on the membrane or micellar structure. We therefore sought to measure stability under native conditions, using a method that does not perturb the properties of the membrane or membrane mimetics. We use a technique called steric trapping to measure the thermodynamic stability of bacteriorhodopsin in bicelles and micelles. We find that bacteriorhodopsin has a high thermodynamic stability, with an unfolding free energy of ‚àº11 kcal/mol in dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine bicelles. Nevertheless, the stability is much lower than predicted by extrapolation of measurements made at high denaturant concentrations. We investigated the discrepancy and found that unfolding free energy is not linear with denaturant concentration. Apparently, long extrapolations of helical membrane protein unfolding free energies must be treated with caution. Steric trapping, however, provides a method for making these measurements.},

abstract = {Binding of specific lipids to large, polytopic membrane proteins is well described, and it is clear that such lipids are crucial for protein stability and activity. In contrast, binding of defined lipid species to individual transmembrane helices and regulation of transmembrane helix monomer-oligomer equilibria by binding of distinct lipids is a concept, which has emerged only lately. Lipids bind to single-span membrane proteins, both in the juxta-membrane region as well as in the hydrophobic membrane core. While some interactions counteract transmembrane helix oligomerization, in other cases lipid binding appears to enhance oligomerization. As reversible oligomerization is involved in activation of many membrane proteins, binding of defined lipids to single-span transmembrane proteins might be a mechanism to regulate and/or fine-tune the protein activity. But how could lipid binding trigger the activity of a protein? How can binding of a single lipid molecule to a transmembrane helix affect the structure of a transmembrane helix oligomer, and consequently its signaling state? These questions are discussed in the present article based on recent results obtained with simple, single-span transmembrane proteins.

abstract = {The molecular activity of Na,K-ATPase and other P2 ATPases like Ca2+-ATPase is influenced by the lipid environment via both general (physical) and specific (chemical) interactions. Whereas the general effects of bilayer structure on membrane protein function are fairly well described and understood, the importance of the specific interactions has only been realized within the last decade due particularly to the growing field of membrane protein crystallization, which has shed new light on the molecular details of specific lipid‚Äìprotein interactions. It is a remarkable observation that specific lipid‚Äìprotein interactions seem to be evolutionarily conserved, and conformations of specifically bound lipids at the lipid‚Äìprotein surface within the membrane are similar in crystal structures determined with different techniques and sources of the protein, despite the rather weak lipid‚Äìprotein interaction energy. Studies of purified detergent-soluble recombinant $\alpha$$\beta$ or $\alpha$$\beta$FXYD Na,K-ATPase complexes reveal three separate functional effects of phospholipids and cholesterol with characteristic structural selectivity. The observations suggest that these three effects are exerted at separate binding sites for phophatidylserine/cholesterol (stabilizing), polyunsaturated phosphatidylethanolamine (stimulatory), and saturated PC or sphingomyelin/cholesterol (inhibitory), which may be located within three lipid-binding pockets identified in recent crystal structures of Na,K-ATPase. The findings point to a central role of direct and specific interactions of different phospholipids and cholesterol in determining both stability and molecular activity of Na,K-ATPase and possible implications for physiological regulation by membrane lipid composition.

abstract = {Biological membranes are essential for normal function and regulation of cells, forming a physical barrier between extracellular and intracellular space and cellular compartments. These physical barriers are subject to mechanical stresses. As a consequence, nature has developed proteins that are able to transpose mechanical stimuli into meaningful intracellular signals. These proteins, termed Mechanosensitive (MS) proteins provide a variety of roles in response to these stimuli. In prokaryotes these proteins form transmembrane spanning channels that function as osmotically activated nanovalves to prevent cell lysis by hypoosmotic shock. In eukaryotes, the function of MS proteins is more diverse and includes physiological processes such as touch, pain and hearing. The transmembrane portion of these channels is influenced by the physical properties such as charge, shape, thickness and stiffness of the lipid bilayer surrounding it, as well as the bilayer pressure profile. In this review we provide an overview of the progress to date on advances in our understanding of the intimate biophysical and chemical interactions between the lipid bilayer and mechanosensitive membrane channels, focusing on current progress in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems. These advances are of importance due to the increasing evidence of the role the MS channels play in disease, such as xerocytosis, muscular dystrophy and cardiac hypertrophy. Moreover, insights gained from lipid‚Äìprotein interactions of MS channels are likely relevant not only to this class of membrane proteins, but other bilayer embedded proteins as well.

With respect to the lipids, effects of mismatch are discussed on lipid chain order, phase transition temperature, lipid phase behavior, and microdomain formation. From these studies, it is concluded that hydrophobic mismatch can strongly affect protein and lipid organization, but that the precise consequences depend on the individual properties of the proteins and lipids. Examples of these properties include the propensity of lipids to form non-lamellar structures, the amino acid composition of the hydrophobic transmembrane segments of the proteins, the nature of the membrane anchoring residues, and the number of transmembrane helices.

To systematically characterize responses of a TM helix and lipid adaptations to a hydrophobic mismatch, we have performed a total of 5.8-$\mu$s umbrella sampling simulations and calculated the potentials of mean force (PMFs) as a function of TM helix tilt angle under various mismatch conditions. Single-pass TM peptides called WALPn (n = 16, 19, 23, and 27) were used in two lipid bilayers with different hydrophobic thicknesses to consider hydrophobic mismatch caused by either the TM length or the bilayer thickness. In addition, different flanking residues, such as alanine, lysine, and arginine, instead of tryptophan in WALP23 were used to examine their influence. The PMFs, their decomposition, and trajectory analysis demonstrate that 1), tilting of a single-pass TM helix is the major response to a hydrophobic mismatch; 2), TM helix tilting up to ‚àº10¬∞ is inherent due to the intrinsic entropic contribution arising from helix precession around the membrane normal even under a negative mismatch; 3), the favorable helix-lipid interaction provides additional driving forces for TM helix tilting under a positive mismatch; 4), the minimum-PMF tilt angle is generally located where there is the hydrophobic match and little lipid perturbation; 5), TM helix rotation is dependent on the specific helix-lipid interaction; and 6), anchoring residues at the hydrophilic/hydrophobic interface can be an important determinant of TM helix orientation.},

abstract = {Accurate prediction of intra-molecular interactions from amino acid sequence is an important pre-requisite for obtaining high-quality protein models. Over the recent years, remarkable progress in this area has been achieved through the application of novel co-variation algorithms, which eliminate transitive evolutionary connections between residues. In this work we present a new contact prediction method for $\alpha$-helical transmembrane proteins, MemConP, in which evolutionary couplings are combined with a machine learning approach. MemConP achieves a substantially improved accuracy (precision: 56.0{\%}, recall: 17.5{\%}, MCC: 0.288) compared to the use of either machine learning or co-evolution methods alone. The method also achieves 91.4{\%} precision, 42.1{\%} recall and a MCC of 0.490 in predicting helix‚Äìhelix interactions based on predicted contacts. The approach was trained and rigorously benchmarked by cross-validation and independent testing on up-to-date non-redundant datasets of 90 and 30 experimental three dimensional structures, respectively. MemConP is a standalone tool that can be downloaded together with the associated training data from http://webclu.bio.wzw.tum.de/MemConP.},

Conformational flexibility currently hinders the structure determination of several classes of membrane receptors and associated oligomers. Here we develop EFDOCKTM, a general method to predict selfassociated transmembrane protein helical (TMH) structures from sequence guided by coevolutionary information. We show that accurate intermolecular contacts can be identified using a combination of protein sequence covariation and TMH binding surfaces predicted from sequence. When applied to diverse TMH oligomers, including receptors characterized in multiple conformational and functional states, the method reaches unprecedented nearatomic accuracy for most targets. Blind predictions of structurally uncharacterized receptor tyrosine kinase TMH oligomers provide a plausible hypothesis on the molecular mechanisms of diseaseassociated point mutations and binding surfaces for the rational design of selective inhibitors. The method sets the stage for uncovering novel determinants of molecular recognition and signalling in singlespanning eukaryotic membrane receptors.},

abstract = {Despite the great importance of membrane proteins, structural and functional studies of these proteins present major challenges. A significant hurdle is the extraction of the functional protein from its natural lipid membrane. Traditionally achieved with detergents, purification procedures can be costly and time consuming. A critical flaw with detergent approaches is the removal of the protein from the native lipid environment required to maintain functionally stable protein. This protocol describes the preparation of styrene maleic acid (SMA) co-polymer to extract membrane proteins from prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems. Successful isolation of membrane proteins into SMA lipid particles (SMALPs) allows the proteins to remain with native lipid, surrounded by SMA. We detail procedures for obtaining 25 g of SMA (4 d); explain the preparation of protein-containing SMALPs using membranes isolated from Escherichia coli (2 d) and control protein-free SMALPS using E. coli polar lipid extract (1‚Äì2 h); investigate SMALP protein purity by SDS‚ÄìPAGE analysis and estimate protein concentration (4 h); and detail biophysical methods such as circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (svAUC) to undertake initial structural studies to characterize SMALPs ({\~{}}2 d). Together, these methods provide a practical tool kit for those wanting to use SMALPs to study membrane proteins.},

Some canonical membrane proteins contain local charge clusters that are important for folding and function, and which have to be compatible with a stable insertion into the bilayer via the translocon. Recently, the electrostatic "charge zipper" has been described as another kind of assembly motif. The protein sequences exhibit a quasi-symmetrical pattern of complementary charges that can form extended ladders of salt bridges. Such segments can insert reversibly into membranes, or even translocate across them. Nature uses charge zippers in transport processes, and they can also be adapted in the design of cell-penetrating carriers. ?? 2014.},

abstract = {The solvent environment regulates the conformational dynamics and functions of solvated proteins. In cell membranes, cholesterol, a major eukaryotic lipid, can markedly modulate protein dynamics. To investigate the nonspecific effects of cholesterol on the dynamics and stability of helical membrane proteins, we monitored association-dissociation dynamics on the antiparallel dimer formation of two simple transmembrane helices (AALALAA)3 with single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) using Cy3B- and Cy5-labeled helices in lipid vesicles (time resolution of 17 ms). The incorporation of 30 mol {\%} cholesterol into phosphatidylcholine bilayers significantly stabilized the helix dimer with average lifetimes of 450-170 ms in 20-35 ¬∞C. Ensemble FRET measurements performed at 15-55 ¬∞C confirmed the cholesterol-induced stabilization of the dimer (at 25 ¬∞C, $\Delta$$\Delta$Ga = -9 kJ mol(-1) and $\Delta$$\Delta$Ha = -60 kJ mol(-1)), most of which originated from "lipophobic" interactions by reducing helix-lipid contacts and the lateral pressure in the hydrocarbon core region. The temperature dependence of the dissociation process (activation energy of 48 kJ) was explained by the Kramers-type frictional barrier in membranes without assuming an enthalpically unfavorable transition state. In addition to these observations, cholesterol-induced tilting of the helices, a positive $\Delta$Cp(a), and slower dimer formation compared with the random collision rate were consistent with a hypothetical model in which cholesterol stabilizes the helix dimer into an hourglass shape to relieve the lateral pressure. Thus, the liposomal single-molecule approach highlighted the significance of the cholesterol-induced basal force for interhelical interactions, which will aid discussions of complex protein-membrane systems.},

Analyzing 12 widely-used and well-known methods using a stringent performance measure, we largely confirmed the expected high level of performance. On the other hand, all methods performed worse for proteins that could not have been used for development. A few results stood out: First, all methods predicted proteins in eukaryotes better than those in bacteria. Second, methods worked less well for proteins with many transmembrane helices. Third, most methods correctly discriminated between soluble and transmem- brane proteins. However, several older methods often mistook signal peptides for transmembrane helices.

A truncated, signaling-deficient interleukin-4 receptor subunit, showing efficient accumulation in the plasma membrane, served as a model transmembrane protein. Two-dimensional diffusion coefficients (D) were determined by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) either at fixed positions (single-point, spFCS) or while scanning a circular orbit (circular scanning, csFCS). Consistent with a different inclusion sizes in the membrane, lipids diffuse slightly faster than the single-spanning membrane proteins in both membrane systems, GUVs and GPMVs. In GPMVs lipids and proteins consistently experienced a fivefold larger viscosity than in GUVs, reflecting the significant fraction of plasma membrane-derived proteins partitioning into GPMVs. Lipid and protein diffusion in the PM was, respectively, 2 times and 4--5 times slower in comparison to GPMVs. This discrepancy was quantitatively confirmed by csFCS. The similarity of diffusion of receptors and lipids in GPMVs and GUVs and its significant difference in the plasma membrane suggest that protein domains as small as EGFP convey sensitivity to the actin cortex on various length scales.},

However, the actual interaction strength of motif-containing helices depends strongly on sequence context and membrane properties.

Bacterial membrane proteins are inserted into the inner membrane by the Sec translocase and YidC insertase.

Glycine zippers and other motifs promote transmembrane-transmembrane (TM-TM) helix interactions that may lead to the formation of $\alpha$-helical bundles of membrane proteins. During or after membrane insertion, the subunits of oligomeric membrane proteins must find each other to build the homo-oligomeric and the hetero-oligomeric membrane complexes. Although chaperones may function as assembly factors in the formation of the oligomer, many protein oligomers appear to fold and oligomerize spontaneously. Current studies show that most subunits of hetero-oligomers follow a sequential and ordered pathway to form the membrane protein complex. If the inserted protein is misfolded or the membrane protein is misassembled, quality control mechanisms exist that can degrade the proteins.},

abstract = {TOPCONS (http://topcons.net/) is a widely used web server for consensus prediction of membrane protein topology. We hereby present a major update to the server, with some substantial improvements, including the following: (i) TOPCONS can now efficiently separate signal peptides from transmembrane regions. (ii) The server can now differentiate more successfully between globular and membrane proteins. (iii) The server now is even slightly faster, although a much larger database is used to generate the multiple sequence alignments. For most proteins, the final prediction is produced in a matter of seconds. (iv) The user-friendly interface is retained, with the additional feature of submitting batch files and accessing the server programmatically using standard interfaces, making it thus ideal for proteome-wide analyses. Indicatively, the user can now scan the entire human proteome in a few days. (v) For proteins with homology to a known 3D structure, the homology-inferred topology is also displayed. (vi) Finally, the combination of methods currently implemented achieves an overall increase in performance by 4{\%} as compared to the currently available best-scoring methods and TOPCONS is the only method that can identify signal peptides and still maintain a state-of-the-art performance in topology predictions.},

@article{Elazar2016,
abstract = {The energetics of membrane-protein interactions determine pro-tein topology and structure: hydrophobicity drives the insertion of helical segments into the membrane, and positive charges orient the protein with respect to the membrane plane according to the positive-inside rule. Until recently, however, quantifying these contributions met with difficulty, precluding systematic analysis of the energetic basis for membrane-protein topology. We recently developed the dsT$\beta$L method, which uses deep sequencing and in vitro selection of segments inserted into the bacterial plasma membrane to infer insertion-energy profiles for each amino acid residue across the membrane, and quantified the insertion contri-bution from hydrophobicity and the positive-inside rule. Here, we present a topology-prediction algorithm called TopGraph, which is based on a sequence search for minimum dsT$\beta$L insertion energy. Whereas the average insertion energy assigned by previous exper-imental scales was positive (unfavorable), the average assigned by TopGraph in a nonredundant set is ‚àí6.9 kcal/mol. By quantifying contributions from both hydrophobicity and the positive-inside rule we further find that in about half of large membrane proteins polar segments are inserted into the membrane to position more positive charges in the cytoplasm, suggesting an interplay between these two energy contributions. Because membrane-embedded polar res-idues are crucial for substrate binding and conformational change, the results implicate the positive-inside rule in determining the ar-chitectures of membrane-protein functional sites. This insight may aid structure prediction, engineering, and design of membrane pro-teins. TopGraph is available online (topgraph.weizmann.ac.il). membrane insertion | topology prediction | positive-inside rule | Bellman‚ÄìFord search T he plasma membrane is a complex physical environment comprising a hydrophobic core and a polar exterior, which is more negatively charged on its cytoplasmic side (1). Two hallmarks of membrane proteins are hydrophobic segments that span the membrane core, and positive charges at the membrane‚Äìcytoplasm interface (the positive-inside rule; ref. 2); these features drive in-sertion and orient segments relative to the membrane plane, respectively. Furthermore, recent work has shown that positive charges placed close to engineered segments can drive mem-brane insertion even of marginally polar segments (3, 4), sug-gesting a role for the positive-inside rule in insertion, and emphasizing the importance of accurate models of membrane-protein energetics for protein engineering and for understanding the physical basis of membrane-protein topology. Topology prediction is a stringent test of our models of membrane-protein energetics. The most parsimonious membrane-topology pre-dictor would locate the membrane-spanning segments and determine their orientations by a sequence search for minimum insertion energy. To achieve that, however, the insertion energy scale must at a mini-mum exhibit two properties: (i) to drive membrane insertion, the hydrophobic amino acids must make large contributions to insertion; and (ii) to orient the protein with respect to the membrane plane, positively charged residues must be strongly favored in the cytoplasm over the extracellular space. These properties, however, were not observed in previous insertion scales (5‚Äì9); instead, topology pre-dictors have relied on machine learning, and used experimentally determined membrane-protein structures to train predictors with hundreds of fitting parameters (10‚Äì15). Although the accuracy of these predictors is high (80‚Äì90{\%}; refs. 10‚Äì16), statistics-based pre-dictors cannot be used to systematically investigate the interplay be-tween different energy contributions to topology. Moreover, such methods are less useful than energy-based methods in predicting to-pology in targets that lack homology to previously characterized proteins (16), and cannot be used to design new proteins. In a landmark study, von Heijne and coworkers measured trans-locon-mediated apparent membrane-insertion energetics of hydro-phobic segments engineered into the leader peptidase (Lep) protein, and derived an insertion scale for every amino acid across the membrane (9, 17). Elofsson and coworkers subsequently incorporated this scale into a hidden Markov model-based topology predictor (10, 18). Although this predictor is a substantial improvement over the statistics-based methods in reducing the number of fitted parameters, the authors noted significant uncertainties; for instance, the Lep scale reported only a small driving force of 0.5 kcal/mol for membrane insertion of the most hydrophobic residues, Leu and Phe, compared with at least 2 kcal/mol in other scales (7, 19), leading Elofsson and coworkers to observe that the Lep scale assigns positive (unfavorable) insertion energies to a large fraction of membrane-spanning segments (10). Furthermore, although it is established that protein orientation with respect to the membrane plane is determined by the positive-inside rule, the Lep measurements reported only a small bias of around 0.5 kcal/mol in favor of Arg and Lys in the cytoplasm compared with the extracellular domain (20), and thereby could not be used to predict orientation. To overcome these problems, the predictor relied on corrections, parameter fitting, and empirical rules in addition to the Lep energetics. To derive higher-confidence insertion energetics we recently developed an experimental method, called deep sequencing TOXCAT-$\beta$-lactamase (dsT$\beta$L), and measured apparent insertion free energies ($\Delta$G},

Recent studies illustrate the ability to differentiate specific lipid binding, preferential interactions with lipid subsets, and nonselective annular contacts.

abstract = {Thermodynamic stabilities are pivotal for understanding structure-function relationships of proteins, and yet such determinations are rare for membrane proteins. Moreover, the few measurements that are available have been conducted under very different experimental conditions, which compromises a straightforward extraction of physical principles underlying stability differences. Here, we have overcome this obstacle and provided structure-stability comparisons for multiple membrane proteins. This was enabled by measurements of the free energies of folding and the m values for the transmembrane proteins PhoP/PhoQ-activated gene product (PagP) and outer membrane protein W (OmpW) from Escherichia coli. Our data were collected in the same lipid bilayer and buffer system we previously used to determine those parameters for E. coli outer membrane phospholipase A (OmpLA). Biophysically, our results suggest that the stabilities of these proteins are strongly correlated to the water-to-bilayer transfer free energy of the lipid-facing residues in their transmembrane regions. We further discovered that the sensitivities of these membrane proteins to chemical denaturation, as judged by their m values, was consistent with that previously observed for water-soluble proteins having comparable differences in solvent exposure between their folded and unfolded states. From a biological perspective, our findings suggest that the folding free energies for these membrane proteins may be the thermodynamic sink that establishes an energy gradient across the periplasm, thus driving their sorting by chaperones to the outer membranes in living bacteria. Binding free energies of these outer membrane proteins with periplasmic chaperones support this energy sink hypothesis.},

Because the lipids that surround membrane proteins in situ spontaneously organize into bilayers, it may seem intuitive that interactions with the bilayer provide both hydrophobic and topological constraints that help the protein to achieve a stable and functional three-dimensional structure. However, one may wonder whether folding is actually driven by the membrane environment or whether the folded state just reflects an adaptation of integral proteins to the medium in which they function. Also, apart from the overall transmembrane orientation, might the asymmetry inherent in biosynthesis processes cause proteins to fold to out-of-equilibrium, metastable topologies?

How transmembrane helix (TMH) sequences encode the topology and conformational flexibility regulating these functions remains poorly understood. Here we describe a comprehensive analysis of the sequence-structure relationships at multiple interacting TMHs from all membrane proteins with structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We found that membrane proteins can be deconstructed in interacting TMH trimer units, which mostly fold into six distinct structural classes of topologies and conformations. Each class is enriched in recurrent sequence motifs from functionally unrelated proteins, revealing unforeseen consensus and evolutionary conserved networks of stabilizing interhelical contacts. Interacting TMHs' topology and local protein conformational flexibility were remarkably well predicted in a blinded fashion from the identified binding-hotspot motifs. Our results reveal universal sequence-structure principles governing the complex anatomy and plasticity of multipass membrane proteins that may guide de novo structure prediction, design, and studies of folding and dynamics.},

abstract = {Motivation: One of the major features of genomic DNA sequences, distinguishing them from texts in most spoken or artificial languages, is their high repetitiveness. Variation in the repetitiveness of  genomic texts reflects the presence and density of different biologically important messages. Thus, deviation from an expected number of repeats in both directions indicates a possible presence of a biological signal. Linguistic complexity corresponds to repetitiveness of a genomic text, and potential regulatory sites may be discovered through construction of typical patterns of complexity distribution.  Results: We developed software for fast calculation of linguistic sequence complexity of DNA sequences. Our program utilizes suffix trees to compute the number of subwords present in genomic sequences,  thereby allowing calculation of linguistic complexity in time linear in genome size. The measure of linguistic complexity was applied to the complete genome of Haemophilus influenzae. Maps of complexity along the entire genome were obtained using sliding windows of 40, 100, and 2000 nucleotides. This approach provided an efficient way to detect simple sequence repeats in this genome. In addition, local profiles of complexity distribution around the starts of translation were constructed for 21 complete prokaryotic genomes. We hypothesize that complexity profiles correspond to evolutionary relationships between organisms. We found principal differences in profiles of the GC-rich and other (non-GC-rich) genomes. We also found characteristic differences in profiles of AT genomes, which probably reflect individual species variations in translational regulation.

abstract = {Data summarization and triage is one of the current top challenges in visual analytics. The goal is to let users visually inspect large data sets and examine or request data with particular characteristics. The need for summarization and visual analytics is also felt when dealing with digital representations of DNA sequences. Genomic data sets are growing rapidly, making their analysis increasingly more difficult, and raising the need for new, scalable tools. For example, being able to look at very large DNA sequences while immediately identifying potentially interesting regions would provide the biologist with a flexible exploratory and analytical tool. In this paper we present a new concept, the "information profile", which provides a quantitative measure of the local complexity of a DNA sequence, independently of the direction of processing. The computation of the information profiles is computationally tractable: we show that it can be done in time proportional to the length of the sequence. We also describe a tool to compute the information profiles of a given DNA sequence, and use the genome of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe strain 972 h(-) and five human chromosomes 22 for illustration. We show that information profiles are useful for detecting large-scale genomic regularities by visual inspection. Several discovery strategies are possible, including the standalone analysis of single sequences, the comparative analysis of sequences from individuals from the same species, and the comparative analysis of sequences from different organisms. The comparison scale can be varied, allowing the users to zoom-in on specific details, or obtain a broad overview of a long segment.

abstract = {A new method to determine entropic profiles in DNA sequences is presented. It is based on the chaos-game representation (CGR) of gene structure, a technique which produces a fractal-like picture of DNA sequences. First, the CGR image was divided into squares 4-m in size (m being the desired resolution), and the point density counted. Second, appropriate intervals were adjusted, and then a histogram of densities was prepared. Third, Shannon's formula was applied to the probability-distribution histogram, thus obtaining a new entropic estimate for DNA sequences, the histogram entropy, a measurement that goes with the level of constraints on the DNA sequence. Lastly, the entropic profile for the sequence was drawn, by considering the entropies at each resolution level, thus providing a way to summarize the complexity of large genomic regions or even entire genomes at different resolution levels. The application of the method to DNA sequences reveals that entropic profiles obtained in this way, as opposed to previously published ones, clearly discriminate between random and natural DNA sequences. Entropic profiles also show a different degree of variability within and between genomes. The results of these analyses are discussed in relation both to the genome compartmentalization in vertebrates and to the differential action of compositional and/or functional constraints on DNA sequences.},

abstract = {Membrane proteins regulate a large number of cellular functions, and have great potential as tools for manipulation of biological systems. Developing these tools requires a robust and quantitative understanding of membrane protein folding and interactions within the bilayer. With this in mind, we have designed a series of proteins to probe the net thermodynamic contribution of well-known sequence motifs to transmembrane helix-helix association in a biological membrane. The proteins were designed from first principles (de novo) using current knowledge about membrane insertion and stabilizing interaction motifs. A simple poly-Leu "scaffold" was decorated with individual helix interaction motifs (G-XXX-G, polar residues, heptad repeat) to create transmembrane helix-helix interactions of increasing strength. The GALLEX assay, an in vivo assay for measurement of transmembrane helix self-association, was combined with computational methods to characterize the relative strength and mode of interaction for each sequence. In addition, the apparent free energy contribution (????G{\textless}sup{\textgreater}app{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) of each motif to transmembrane helix self-association was measured in a biological membrane, results that are the first of their kind for these de novo designed sequences, and suggest that the free energy barrier to overcoming weak association is quite small ({\textless} 1.4 kcal mol{\textless}sup{\textgreater}- 1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) in a natural membrane. By quantifying and rationalizing the contribution of key motifs to transmembrane helix association, our work offers a route to direct the design of novel sequences for use in biotechnology or synthetic biology (e.g. molecular switches) and to predict the effects of sequence modification in known transmembrane domains (for control of cellular processes).},

abstract = {Proteins employ a wide variety of folds to perform their biological functions. How are these folds first acquired? An important step toward answering this is to obtain an estimate of the overall prevalence of sequences adopting functional folds. Since tertiary structure is needed for a typical enzyme active site to form, one way to obtain this estimate is to measure the prevalence of sequences supporting a working active site. Although the immense number of sequence combinations makes wholly random sampling unfeasible, two key simplifications may provide a solution. First, given the importance of hydrophobic interactions to protein folding, it seems likely that the sample space can be restricted to sequences carrying the hydropathic signature of a known fold. Second, because folds are stabilized by the cooperative action of many local interactions distributed throughout the structure, the overall problem of fold stabilization may be viewed reasonably as a collection of coupled local problems. This enables the difficulty of the whole problem to be assessed by assessing the difficulty of several smaller problems. Using these simplifications, the difficulty of specifying a working ??-lactamase domain is assessed here. An alignment of homologous domain sequences is used to deduce the pattern of hydropathic constraints along chains that form the domain fold. Starting with a weakly functional sequence carrying this signature, clusters of ten side-chains within the fold are replaced randomly, within the boundaries of the signature, and tested for function. The prevalence of low-level function in four such experiments indicates that roughly one in 10
                        64 signature-consistent sequences forms a working domain. Combined with the estimated prevalence of plausible hydropathic patterns (for any fold) and of relevant folds for particular functions, this implies the overall prevalence of sequences performing a specific function by any domain-sized fold may be as low as 1 in 10
                        77, adding to the body of evidence that functional folds require highly extraordinary sequences. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Whole cells of Salmonella typhimurium were treated with Bacillus cereus phospholipase C or with CNBr-activated dextran. If phosphatidylethanolamine head groups are exposed and accessible on the outer surface of the outer membrane of these cells, it was expected that these groups would be hydrolyzed by the former agent, and become covalently coupled to the latter agent. With strains producing lipopolysaccharides of S or Rc type, results did not indicate the presence of any accessible head groups on the outer surface. In contrast, with strains that produce outer membranes containing less complete lipopolysaccharides (Rd or Re type) and reduced amounts of proteins, both methods clearly showed the presence of exposed phosphatidylethanolamine head groups. These data can be most easily explained by assuming that the outer membranes of S and Rc strains either contains all phospholipid molecules in its inner leaflet or has proteins that completely cover up the head groups at its outer surface. In either model, the reduction in the amount of outer membrane proteins in Rd or Re mutants would produce membranes with exposed phospholipid head groups. CNBr-activated dextran can be easily prepared, and reacts with high efficiency under near-physiological conditions. Its additional advantage as a nonpenetrating membrane-labeling reagent is that we can be quite confident on its impermeability because of its size, in contrast, with most other reagents whose presumed impermeability is dependent only on the presence of charged groups.},

Cells in culture transfected with these cDNAs displayed the expected subcellular localization by light and electron microscopy and reported local pH that was calibrated in situ with ionophores. We monitored cytosolic and nuclear pH of HeLa cells, and mitochondrial matrix pH in HeLa cells and in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. The pH of the medial/trans-Golgi was measured at steady-state (calibrated to be 6.58 in HeLa cells) and after various manipulations. These demonstrated that the Golgi membrane in intact cells is relatively permeable to H+, and that Cl‚àí serves as a counter-ion for H+ transport and likely helps to maintain electroneutrality. The amenability to engineer GFPs to specific subcellular locations or tissue targets using gene fusion and transfer techniques should allow us to examine pH at sites previously inaccessible. },

abstract = {The progressive acidification of the endocytic pathway is generated by H(+) pumping of electrogenic vacuolar-type ATPases (V-ATPases) on the endosomal/lysosomal membrane. The determinants of pH during endosome maturation are not completely understood, but the permeability to ions that neutralize the electrogenic effect of the V-ATPase has been proposed to play a central role. If counter-ion conductance becomes limiting, the generation of a large membrane potential would dominate the proton-motive force (pmf), diminishing the pH gradient proportionally. Validation of this notion requires direct measurement of the electrical potential that develops across the endosomal/lysosomal membrane. To date, the measurement of lysosomal membrane potential ($\psi$($\phi$) ) in situ has been hampered by the inability to access endosomes by electrophysiological means and the fact that individual organelles cannot be discerned when using potentiometric fluorescent dyes. Here, we describe a noninvasive procedure to estimate $\psi$($\phi$) in intact cells, based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). At steady state, $\psi$($\phi$) averaged 19 mV (lumen positive) and was only partially dissipated by inhibition of the V-ATPase with concanamycin A (CcA). $\psi$($\phi$) was considerably increased by alkalinization of the lysosome lumen by NH(4) Cl, implying that at steady state the V-ATPase operates at submaximal rates and that the contribution of $\psi$($\phi$) to pmf is relatively small. Our method should enable systematic studies of endosomal/lysosomal potential.},

Prevention of Ca2+ store refilling with thapsigargin produced a sustained depolarization, leading to enhanced Ca2+ influx and an elevation in [Ca2+]i in 12 mM glucose. Depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by external EGTA reduced [Ca2+]i and also caused a long-lasting depolarization. In single beta-cells, external EGTA activated an inward current, the voltage range and kinetic properties of which differed from those of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. A novel pathway thus exists in beta-cells by which depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores results in the activation of an inward current that, by inducing depolarization, facilitates Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The physiological relevance of this pathway in the control of beta-cell function is indicated by the stimulation of insulin secretion by thapsigargin.},

The Mass Action equation, as such, is not directly applicable for the analysis of the binding of oxygen to oligomers such as hemoglobin. When the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin is analyzed, models incorporating extensions of mass action are employed. Oxidation-reduction reactions of the heme group in myoglobin and hemoglobin involve the binding and dissociation of electrons. This reaction is described with the Nernst equation. The Nernst equation is applicable only to a monomeric species even if the number of electrons involved is greater than unity. To analyze the oxidation-reduction reaction in a molecule such as hemoglobin a model is required which incorporates extensions of the Nernst equation. This communication develops models employing the Nernst equation for oxidation-reduction reactions analogous to those employed for hemoglobin in the analysis of the oxygenation (binding of oxygen) reaction.},

A quantitative description of the coupling of structure formation to partitioning, which may provide a basis for understanding membrane protein folding and insertion, requires an appropriate free energy scale for partitioning. A complete interfacial hydrophobicity scale that includes the contribution of the peptide bond was therefore determined from the partitioning of two series of small model peptides into the interfaces of neutral (zwitterionic) phospholipid membranes. Aromatic residues are found to be especially favoured at the interface while charged residues, and the peptide bond, are disfavoured about equally. Reduction of the high cost of partitioning the peptide bond through hydrogen bonding may be important in the promotion of structure formation in the membrane interface.},

(1) Helix lengths range from 14 to 36 residues with an average length of 26.4 residues. There is a preference for lengths greater than 20 residues. (2) The helices are tilted with respect to the bilayer normal by an average of 21¬∞, but there is a decided preference for smaller tilt angles. (3) The distribution of helix packing angles is very different than for soluble proteins. The most common packing angles for TM helices are centered around +20¬∞ while for soluble proteins packing angles of around ‚àí35¬∞ are the most prevalent. (4) The average distance of closest approach is 9.6 {\AA}, which is the same as soluble proteins. (5) There is no preference for the positioning of the point of closest approach along the length of the helices. (6) It is almost a rule that TM helices pack against neighbors in the sequence. Of the 37 helices that have a sequence neighbor, 36 of them are in significant contact with a neighbor. (7) An antiparallel orientation is more prevalent than a parallel orientation and antiparallel interactions are more intimate on average. The general features of helix bundle membrane protein architecture described in this survey should prove useful in the modeling of helix bundle transmembrane proteins.},

abstract = {Non-structural protein 2 (NS2) plays a crucial role in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) assembly. NS2 was predicted to be composed of three transmembrane (TM) segments. However, the mechanism of interactions between TM segments of NS2 and surrounding lipid environment remains unclear. Molecular dynamics simulations were applied to investigate the conformation and orientation of the first transmembrane segment (TM1) as well as the interactions of TM1 with a zwitterionic POPC lipid bilayer which identifies several key residues that stabilize the position of TM1 within the membrane. Along with the charged residues R3 and K27, the S23 and H25 were found to be the key elements in establishing the conformation of TM1 inside the membrane. The peptide forms a stable ??-helix (the sequence 12???21) connected to N-terminal haft in POPC bilayer. The results also reveal that TM1 induces the ordering of lipid and does not destabilize the lipid bilayer system. The hydrophobic mismatch in which the segment tilts an angle along the membrane normal was observed in this system. The binding free energy profile of TM1 to the membrane was also estimated using umbrella sampling.},

abstract = {??-Helical membrane proteins are largely composed of nonpolar residues that are embedded in the lipid bilayer. An enigma in the folding of membrane proteins is how a polypeptide chain can be condensed into the compact folded state in the environment where the hydrophobic effect cannot strongly drive molecular interactions. Probably other forces such as van der Waals packing, hydrogen bonding, and weakly polar interactions, which are regarded less important in the folding of water-soluble proteins, should emerge. However, it is not clearly understood how those individual forces operate and how they are balanced for stabilizing membrane proteins. Studying this problem is not a trivial task mainly because of the methodological challenges in controlling the reversible folding of membrane proteins in the lipid bilayer. Overcoming the hurdles, meaningful progress has been made in the field in the last few decades. This review will focus on recent studies tackling the problem of driving forces in membrane protein folding.},

In this study we find that kinks are a feature of long $\alpha$-helices in both soluble and membrane proteins, rather than just transmembrane $\alpha$-helices. The apparent rarity of kinks in soluble proteins is due to the relative infrequency of long helices (‚â•20 residues) in these proteins. We compare length-matched sets of soluble and membrane helices, and find that the frequency of kinks, the role of Proline, the patterns of other amino acid around kinks (allowing for the expected differences in amino acid distributions between the two types of protein), and the effects of hydrogen bonds are the same for the two types of helices. In both types of protein, helices that contain Proline in the second and subsequent turns are very frequently kinked. However, there are a sizeable proportion of kinked helices that do not contain a Proline in either their sequence or sequence homolog. Moreover, we observe that in soluble proteins, kinked helices have a structural preference in that they typically point into the solvent.

This review summarises recent data on the mechanisms of luminal Ca2+-dependent regulation of Ca2+ release and uptake as well as ER regulation of cellular adaptive processes. In addition we discuss general biophysical properties of the ER membrane, as trans-endomembrane Ca2+ fluxes are subject to basic electrical forces, determined by factors such as the membrane potential of the ER and the ease with which Ca2+ fluxes are able to change this potential (i.e. the resistance of the ER membrane). Although these electrical forces undoubtedly play a fundamental role in shaping [Ca2+]ER dynamics, at present there is very little direct experimental information about the biophysical properties of the ER membrane. Further studies of how intraluminal [Ca2+] is regulated, best carried out with direct measurements, are vital for understanding how Ca2+ orchestrates cell function. Direct monitoring of [Ca2+]ER under conditions where the cytosolic [Ca2+] is known may also help to capture elusive biophysical information about the ER, such as the potential difference across the ER membrane. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Knowledge of the transmembrane helical topology can help identify binding sites and infer functions for membrane proteins. However, because membrane proteins are hard to solubilize and purify, only a very small amount of membrane proteins have structure and topology experimentally determined. This has motivated various computational methods for predicting the topology of membrane proteins. RESULTS: We present an improved hidden Markov model, TMMOD, for the identification and topology prediction of transmembrane proteins. Our model uses TMHMM as a prototype, but differs from TMHMM by the architecture of the submodels for loops on both sides of the membrane and also by the model training procedure. In cross-validation experiments using a set of 83 transmembrane proteins with known topology, TMMOD outperformed TMHMM and other existing methods, with an accuracy of 89{\%} for both topology and locations. In another experiment using a separate set of 160 transmembrane proteins, TMMOD had 84{\%} for topology and 89{\%} for locations. When utilized for identifying transmembrane proteins from non-transmembrane proteins, particularly signal peptides, TMMOD has consistently fewer false positives than TMHMM does. Application of TMMOD to a collection of complete genomes shows that the number of predicted membrane proteins accounts for approximately 20-30{\%} of all genes in those genomes, and that the topology where both the N- and C-termini are in the cytoplasm is dominant in these organisms except for Caenorhabditis elegans.

abstract = {We implement the replica exchange molecular dynamics algorithm to study the interactions of a model peptide (WALP-16) with an explicitly represented DPPC membrane bilayer. We observe the spontaneous, unbiased insertion of WALP-16 into the DPPC bilayer and its folding into an alpha-helix with a transbilayer orientation. The free energy surface suggests that the insertion of the peptide into the DPPC bilayer precedes secondary structure formation. Although the peptide has some propensity to form a partially helical structure in the interfacial region of the DPPC/water system, this state is not a productive intermediate but rather an off-pathway trap for WALP-16 insertion. Equilibrium simulations show that the observed insertion/folding pathway mirrors the potential of mean force (PMF). Calculation of the enthalpic and entropic contributions to this PMF show that the surface bound conformation of WALP-16 is significantly lower in energy than other conformations, and that the insertion of WALP-16 into the bilayer without regular secondary structure is enthalpically unfavorable by 5-10 kcal/mol/residue. The observed insertion/folding pathway disagrees with the dominant conceptual model, which is that a surface-bound helix is an obligatory intermediate for the insertion of alpha-helical peptides into lipid bilayers. In our simulations, the observed insertion/folding pathway is favored because of a large ({\textgreater}100 kcal/mol) increase in system entropy that occurs when the unstructured WALP-16 peptide enters the lipid bilayer interior. The insertion/folding pathway that is lowest in free energy depends sensitively on the near cancellation of large enthalpic and entropic terms. This suggests the possibility that intrinsic membrane peptides may have a diversity of insertion/folding behaviors depending on the exact system of peptide and lipid under consideration.},

abstract = {We used solid-state deuterium NMR spectroscopy and an approach involving geometric analysis of labeled alanines (GALA method) to examine the structure and orientation of a designed synthetic hydrophobic, membrane-spanning alpha-helical peptide in phosphatidylcholine (PC) bilayers. The 19-amino-acid peptide consists of an alternating leucine and alanine core, flanked by tryptophans that serve as interfacial anchors: acetyl-GWW(LA)(6)LWWA-ethanolamine (WALP19). A single deuterium-labeled alanine was introduced at different positions within the peptide. Peptides were incorporated in oriented bilayers of dilauroyl- (di-C12:0-), dimyristoyl- (di-C14:0-), or dioleoyl- (di-C18:1(c)-) phosphatidylcholine. The NMR data fit well to a WALP19 orientation characterized by a distinctly nonzero tilt, approximately 4 degrees from the membrane normal, and rapid reorientation about the membrane normal in all three lipids. Although the orientation of WALP19 varies slightly in the different lipids, hydrophobic mismatch does not seem to be the dominant factor causing the tilt. We suggest rather that the peptide itself has an inherently preferred tilted orientation, possibly related to peptide surface characteristics or the disposition of tryptophan indole anchors relative to the lipids, the peptide backbone, and the membrane/water interface. Additionally, the data allow us to define more precisely the local alanine geometry in this membrane-spanning alpha-helix.},

abstract = {We examined the effect of ionizable residues at positions flanking the hydrophobic core of helix-forming polyLeu peptides upon helix-helix interactions within model membrane vesicles composed of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine. The peptides studied were flanked on both the N and C termini either by two Lys (K(2)-flanked peptide), one Lys plus one Asp (DK-flanked peptide), or one Lys plus three Asp (KD(3)-flanked peptide). The fluorescence of a Trp residue positioned at the center of the hydrophobic sequence was used to evaluate peptide behavior. As judged by the concentration dependence of the maximum wavelength of Trp emission, there was significant oligomerization of the KD(3)- and DK-flanked peptides, but not the K(2)-flanked peptide, at neutral pH. At neutral pH mixtures of K(2)- and KD(3)-flanked peptides associated with each other, but mixtures of the K(2)- and DK-flanked peptides did not. Oligomerization by the DK- and KD(3)-flanked peptides decreased under low pH conditions in which the Asp residues were protonated. Additional experiments showed that at neutral pH the KD(3)-flanked peptide showed an increased tendency to oligomerize when as little as 10-15 mol {\%} of an anionic lipid, phosphatidylglycerol, was present. The behavior of the other peptides was not strongly influenced by phosphatidylglycerol. These results can largely be explained by modulation of helix-helix interactions via electrostatic interactions involving the helix-flanking ionizable residues. Such interactions may influence membrane protein folding. The self-association of anionic KD(3)-flanked peptides suggests that additional interactions involving charged residues also can modulate helix-helix association.},

abstract = {TA (tail-anchored) proteins utilize distinct biosynthetic pathways, including TRC40 (transmembrane domain recognition complex of 40 kDa)-mediated, chaperone-dependent and/or unassisted routes to the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) membrane. We have addressed the flexibility of cytosolic components participating in these pathways, and explored the thermodynamic constraints of their membrane insertion, by exploiting recombinant forms of Sec61$\beta$ and Cytb5 (cytochrome b5) bearing covalent modifications within their TA region. In both cases, efficient membrane insertion relied on cytosolic factors capable of accommodating a surprising range of covalent modifications to the TA region. For Sec61$\beta$, we found that both SGTA (small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein $\alpha$) and TRC40 can bind this substrate with a singly PEGylated TA region. However, by introducing two PEG [poly(ethylene glycol)] moieties, TRC40 binding can be prevented, resulting in a block of subsequent membrane integration. Although TRC40 can bind Sec61$\beta$ polypeptides singly PEGylated at different locations, membrane insertion is more sensitive to the precise location of PEG attachment. Modelling and experimentation indicate that this post-TRC40 effect results from an increased energetic cost of inserting different PEGylated TA regions into the lipid bilayer. We therefore propose that the membrane integration of TA proteins delivered via TRC40 is strongly dependent upon underlying thermodynamics, and speculate that their insertion is via a phospholipid-mediated process.},

abstract = {Efficient delivery of membrane proteins is a critical cellular process. The recently elucidated GET (Guided Entry of TA proteins) pathway is responsible for the targeted delivery of tail-anchored (TA) membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum. The central player is the ATPase Get3, which in its free form exists as a dimer. Biochemical evidence suggests a role for a tetramer of Get3. Here, we present the first crystal structure of an archaeal Get3 homologue that exists as a tetramer and is capable of TA protein binding. The tetramer generates a hydrophobic chamber that we propose binds the TA protein. We use small-angle X-ray scattering to provide the first structural information of a fungal Get3/TA protein complex showing that the overall molecular envelope is consistent with the archaeal tetramer structure. Moreover, we show that this fungal tetramer complex is capable of TA insertion. This allows us to suggest a model where a tetramer of Get3 sequesters a TA protein during targeting to the membrane.},

Cleavage within the transmembrane domain provides an attractive mechanism to facilitate protein dislocation but has never been shown for endogenous substrates. To determine whether intramembrane proteolysis, specifically cleavage by the intramembrane-cleaving aspartyl protease signal peptide peptidase (SPP), is involved in this pathway, we generated an SPP-specific somatic cell knockout. In a stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture-based proteomics screen, we identified HO-1 (heme oxygenase-1), the rate-limiting enzyme in the degradation of heme to biliverdin, as a novel SPP substrate. Intramembrane cleavage by catalytically active SPP provided the primary proteolytic step required for the extraction and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation of HO-1, an ER-resident tail-anchored protein. SPP-mediated proteolysis was not limited to HO-1 but was required for the dislocation and degradation of additional tail-anchored ER-resident proteins. Our study identifies tail-anchored proteins as novel SPP substrates and a specific requirement for SPP-mediated intramembrane cleavage in protein turnover.},

abstract = {The members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins are crucial regulators of apoptosis. In order to determine cell fate, these proteins must be targeted to distinct intracellular membranes, including the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM), the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and its associated nuclear envelope. The targeting sequences and mechanisms that mediate the specificity of these proteins for a particular cellular membrane remain poorly defined. Several Bcl-2 family members have been reported to be tail-anchored via their predicted hydrophobic COOH-terminal transmembrane domains (TMDs). Tail-anchoring imposes a posttranslational mechanism of membrane insertion on the already folded protein, suggesting that the transient binding of cytosolic chaperone proteins to the hydrophobic TMD may be an important regulatory event in the targeting process. The TMD of certain family members is initially concealed and only becomes available for targeting and membrane insertion in response to apoptotic stimuli. These proteins either undergo a conformational change, posttranslational modification or a combination of these events enabling them to translocate to sites at which they are functional. Some Bcl-2 family members lack a TMD, but nevertheless localize to the MOM or the ER membrane during apoptosis where they execute their functions. In this review, we will focus on the intracellular targeting of Bcl-2 family members and the mechanisms by which they translocate to their sites of action. Furthermore, we will discuss the posttranslational modifications which regulate these events. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Membrane insertion by the Sec61 translocon in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is highly dependent on hydrophobicity. This places stringent hydrophobicity requirements on transmembrane domains (TMDs) from single-spanning membrane proteins. On examining the single-spanning influenza A membrane proteins, we found that the strict hydrophobicity requirement applies to the N(out)-C(in) HA and M2 TMDs but not the N(in)-C(out) TMDs from the type II membrane protein neuraminidase (NA). To investigate this discrepancy, we analyzed NA TMDs of varying hydrophobicity, followed by increasing polypeptide lengths, in mammalian cells and ER microsomes. Our results show that the marginally hydrophobic NA TMDs ($\Delta$G(app) {\textgreater} 0 kcal/mol) require the cotranslational insertion process for facilitating their inversion during translocation and a positively charged N-terminal flanking residue and that NA inversion enhances its plasma membrane localization. Overall the cotranslational inversion of marginally hydrophobic NA TMDs initiates once {\~{}}70 amino acids past the TMD are synthesized, and the efficiency reaches 50{\%} by {\~{}}100 amino acids, consistent with the positioning of this TMD class in type II human membrane proteins.

Here we elucidate the role of coherence in determining the efficiency of charge separation in the plant photosystem II reaction centre by comprehensively combining experiment (two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy) and theory (Redfield theory). We reveal the presence of electronic coherence between excitons as well as between exciton and charge-transfer states that we argue to be maintained by vibrational modes.

abstract = {The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated CoV (SARS-CoV) mediates membrane fusion and viral entry. These events involve structural rearrangements, including heteromerization between two heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) to form a trimer of dimers as a six-helix bundle (6-HB), a quaternary protein structure that brings two distant clusters of hydrophobic sequences into the proximity of each other, the internal fusion peptide (IFP) preceding HR1, and the highly conserved tryptophan (Trp)-rich membrane proximal external region (MPER) following HR2. Here, we show that MPER can undergo self-oligomerization and heteromerization with IFP, events that are Trp-dependent. To delineate the roles of Trp residues of MPER in forming these quaternary structures and interacting with membranes, we employed a panel of synthetic peptides: MPER peptide (M-wt) and its alanine (Ala) and phenylalanine (Phe) analogues. Ala substitutions of Trp inhibited its association with cellular membranes. Chemical cross-linking experiments showed that M-wt can self-interact to form oligomers and cross-interact with IFP23, a synthetic IFP peptide, to form a heterohexamer. In comparison, little high-order oligomer was formed between M-wt and fusion peptide. The specific interaction between M-wt and IFP23 was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining experiments. In aqueous solutions, both M-wt and IFP23 displayed random secondary structures that became helical in hydrophobic solvents. Triple-Ala substitutions of Trp in M-wt, but not the corresponding triple-Phe analogue, disrupted oligomerization of M-wt and hetero-oligomerization of M-wt with IFP23. Overall, our results show that Trp residues of MPER play a key role in maintaining the structure and functions of MPER, allowing it to interact with IFP to form a MPER-IFP heteromer, a putative quaternary structure extending from the 6-HB, and function in membrane fusion. Finally, we showed that a MPER peptide could serve as an inhibitor in the entry process.},

Both Trp and Phe tend to push the transmembrane helix into the membrane when inserted in positions flanking the poly-Leu stretch, and Trp (but not Phe) pulls the transmembrane helix toward the lipid-water interface when inserted inside the poly-Leu segment. Thus, the preference of Trp for the lipid-water interface previously suggested on the basis of biophysical studies of model peptides can also be observed for a bona fide transmembrane helix in a biological membrane. We further show that a sufficiently long poly-Trp segment functions as an efficient stop-transfer sequence during protein translocation across the microsomal membrane, despite the preference of Trp residues for the lipid-water interface region.},

abstract = {The minimum hydrophobic length necessary to form a transmembrane (TM) helix in membranes was investigated using model membrane-inserted hydrophobic helices. The fluorescence of a Trp at the center of the sequence and its sensitivity to quenching were used to ascertain helix position within the membrane. Peptides with hydrophobic cores composed of poly(Leu) were compared to sequences containing a poly 1:1 Leu:Ala core (which have a hydrophobicity typical of natural TM helices). Studies varying bilayer width revealed that the poly(Leu) core peptides predominately formed a TM state when the bilayer width exceeded hydrophobic sequence length by (i.e. when negative mismatch was) up to ‚àº 11-12¬†{\AA} (e.g. the case of a 11-12 residue hydrophobic sequence in bilayers with a biologically relevant width, i.e. dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayers), while poly(LeuAla) core peptides formed predominantly TM state with negative mismatch of up to 9¬†{\AA} (a 13 residue hydrophobic sequence in DOPC bilayers). This indicates that minimum length necessary to form a predominating amount of a TM state (minimum TM length) is only modestly hydrophobicity-dependent for the sequences studied here, and a formula that defines the minimum TM length as a function of hydrophobicity for moderately-to-highly hydrophobic sequences was derived. The minimum length able to form a stable TM helix for alternating LeuAla sequences, and that for sequences with a Leu block followed by an Ala block, was similar, suggesting that a hydrophobicity gradient along the sequence may not be an important factor in TM stability. TM stability was also similar for sequences flanked by different charged ionizable residues (Lys, His, Asp). However, ionizable flanking residues destabilized the TM configuration much more when charged than when uncharged. The ability of short hydrophobic sequences to form TM helices in membranes in the presence of substantial negative mismatch implies that lipid bilayers have a considerable ability to adjust to negative mismatch, and that short TM helices may be more common than generally believed. Factors that modulate the ability of bilayers to adjust to mismatch may strongly affect the configuration of short hydrophobic helices. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {To investigate the effect of lipid structure upon the membrane topography of hydrophobic helices, the behavior of hydrophobic peptides was studied in model membrane vesicles. To define topography, fluorescence and fluorescence quenching methods were used to determine the location of a Trp at the center of the hydrophobic sequence. For peptides with cationic residues flanking the hydrophobic sequence, the stability of the transmembrane (TM) configuration (relative to a membrane-bound non-TM state) increased as a function of lipid composition on the order: 1:1 (mol:mol) 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC):1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine ??? 6:4 POPC:cholesterol {\textless} POPC ??? dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) {\textless} 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] sodium salt (DOPG) ??? 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-l-serine] sodium salt (DOPS), indicating that the anionic lipids DOPG and DOPS most strongly stabilized the TM configuration. TM stabilization was near maximal at 20-30??mol{\%} anionic lipid, which are physiologically relevant values. TM stabilization by anionic lipid was observed for hydrophobic sequences with a diverse set of sequences (including polyAla), diverse lengths (from 12 to 22 residues), and various cationic flanking residues (H, R, or K), but not when the flanking residues were uncharged. TM stabilization by anionic lipid was also dependent on the number of cationic residues flanking the hydrophobic sequence, but was still significant with only one cationic residue flanking each end of the peptide. These observations are consistent with TM-stabilizing effects being electrostatic in origin. However, Trp located more deeply in DOPS vesicles relative to DOPG vesicles, and peptides in DOPS vesicles showed increased helix formation relative to DOPG and all other lipid compositions. These observations fit a model in which DOPS anchors flanking residues near the membrane surface more strongly than does DOPG and/or increases the stability of the TM state to a greater degree than DOPG. We conclude that anionic lipids can have significant and headgroup structure-specific effects upon membrane protein topography. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A major challenge in the research on membrane-anchored and integral membrane protein complexes is to obtain these in a functionally active, water-soluble, and monodisperse form. This requires the incorporation of the membrane proteins into a native-like membrane or detergent micelle that mimics the properties of the original biological membrane. However, solubilization in detergents or reconstitution in liposomes or supported monolayers sometimes suffers from loss of activity and problematic analyses due to heterogeneity and aggregation. A developing technology termed nanodiscs exploits discoidal phospholipid bilayers encircled by a stabilizing amphipatic helical membrane scaffold protein to reconstitute membranes with integral proteins. After reconstitution, the membrane nanodisc is soluble, stable, and monodisperse. In the present review, we outline the biological inspiration for nanodiscs as discoidal high-density lipoproteins, the assembly and handling of nanodiscs, and finally their diverse biochemical applications. In our view, major advantages of nanodisc technology for integral membrane proteins is homogeneity, control of oligomerization state, access to both sides of the membrane, and control of lipids in the local membrane environment of the integral protein.},

The $\alpha$(ŒôŒôb)$\beta$(3) TMD structure indicates that precise $\beta$(3) TMD crossing angles enable the assembly of outer and inner membrane 'clasps' that hold the $\alpha$$\beta$ TMD together to limit transmembrane signalling. Mutation of $\beta$(3)(Lys‚Äâ716) caused dissociation of $\alpha$(ŒôŒôb)$\beta$(3) TMDs and integrin activation. To confirm that altered topography of $\beta$(3)(Lys‚Äâ716) mutants activated $\alpha$(ŒôŒôb)$\beta$(3), we used directed evolution of $\beta$(3)(K716A) to identify substitutions restoring default state. Introduction of Pro(711) at the midpoint of $\beta$(3) TMD (A711P) increased $\alpha$(ŒôŒôb)$\beta$(3) TMD association and inactivated integrin $\alpha$(ŒôŒôb)$\beta$(3)(A711P,K716A). $\beta$(3)(Pro‚Äâ711) introduced a TMD kink of 30‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ1¬∞ precisely at the border of the outer and inner membrane clasps, thereby decoupling the tilt between these segments. Thus, widely occurring snorkelling residues in TMDs can help maintain TMD topography and membrane-embedding, thereby regulating transmembrane signalling.},

Current data on structurally related modulators suggest that cholesterol binds to subunit interfaces between transmembrane domains of the GABAAR. We construct homology models of a human GABAAR based on the structure of the glutamate-gated chloride channel GluCl of Caenorhabditis elegans. The models show the possibility of previously unreported disulfide bridges linking the M1 and M3 transmembrane helices in the ?? and ?? subunits. We discuss the biological relevance of such disulfide bridges. Using our models, we investigate cholesterol binding to intersubunit cavities of the GABAAR transmembrane domain. We find that very similar binding modes are predicted independently by three approaches: analogy with ivermectin in the GluCl crystal structure, automated docking by AutoDock, and spontaneous rebinding events in unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. Taken together, the models and atomistic simulations suggest a somewhat flexible binding mode, with several possible orientations. Finally, we explore the possibility that cholesterol promotes pore opening through a wedge mechanism. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {The architecture of a biological membrane hinges upon the fundamental fact that its properties are determined by more than the sum of its individual components. Studies on model membranes have shown the need to characterize in molecular detail how properties such as thickness, fluidity, and macroscopic bending rigidity are regulated by the interactions between individual molecules in a non-trivial fashion. Simulation-based approaches are invaluable to this purpose but are typically limited to short sampling times and model systems that are often smaller than the required properties. To alleviate both limitations, the use of coarse-grained (CG) models is nowadays an established computational strategy. We here present a new CG force field for cholesterol, which was developed by using measured properties of small molecules, and can be used in combination with our previously developed force field for phospholipids. The new model performs with precision comparable to atomistic force fields in predicting the properties of cholesterol-rich phospholipid bilayers, including area per lipid, bilayer thickness, tail order parameter, increase in bending rigidity, and propensity to form liquid-ordered domains in ternary mixtures. We suggest the use of this model to quantify the impact of cholesterol on macroscopic properties and on microscopic phenomena involving localization and trafficking of lipids and proteins on cellularmembranes.},

We have performed molecular dynamics simulations of trans-membrane KALP peptides (sequence: GKK(LA)nLKKA) in phospholipid bilayers to investigate hydrophobic mismatch alleviation mechanisms. By varying systematically the length of the peptide (KALP15, KALP19, KALP23, KALP27, and KALP31) and the lipid hydrophobic length (DLPC, DMPC, and DPPC), a wide range of mismatch conditions were studied. Simulations of durations of 50-200 ns show that under positive mismatch, the system alleviates the mismatch predominantly by tilting the peptide and to a smaller extent by increased lipid ordering in the immediate vicinity of the peptide. Under negative mismatch, alleviation takes place by a combination of local bilayer bending and the snorkeling of the lysine residues of the peptide. Simulations performed at a higher peptide/lipid molar ratio (1:25) reveal slower dynamics of both the peptide and lipid relative to those at a lower peptide/lipid ratio (1:128). The lysine residues have favorable interactions with specific oxygen atoms of the phospholipid headgroups, indicating the preferred localization of these residues at the lipid/water interface.},

abstract = {The free energy of transfer of nonpolar solutes from water to lipid bilayers is often dominated by a large negative enthalpy rather than the large positive entropy expected from the hydrophobic effect. This common observation has led to the idea that membrane partitioning is driven by the "nonclassical" hydrophobic effect. We examined this phenomenon by characterizing the partitioning of the well-studied peptide melittin using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and circular dichroism (CD). We studied the temperature dependence of the entropic (-T$\Delta$S) and enthalpic ($\Delta$H) components of free energy ($\Delta$G) of partitioning of melittin into lipid membranes made of various mixtures of zwitterionic and anionic lipids. We found significant variations of the entropic and enthalpic components with temperature, lipid composition and vesicle size but only small changes in $\Delta$G (entropy-enthalpy compensation). The heat capacity associated with partitioning had a large negative value of about -0.5 kcal mol(-1) K(-1). This hallmark of the hydrophobic effect was found to be independent of lipid composition. The measured heat capacity values were used to calculate the hydrophobic-effect free energy $\Delta$G (h$\Phi$), which we found to dominate melittin partitioning regardless of lipid composition. In the case of anionic membranes, additional free energy comes from coulombic attraction, which is characterized by a small effective peptide charge due to the lack of additivity of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions in membrane interfaces [Ladokhin and White J Mol Biol 309:543-552, 2001]. Our results suggest that there is no need for a special effect-the nonclassical hydrophobic effect-to describe partitioning into lipid bilayers.},

Membrane-embedded transporters move ions and larger solutes across membranes; receptors mediate communication between the cell and its environment and membrane-embedded enzymes catalyze chemical reactions. Understanding these mechanisms of action requires knowledge of how the proteins couple to their fluid, hydrated lipid membrane environment. We present here current studies in computational and experimental membrane protein biophysics, and show how they address outstanding challenges in understanding the complex environmental effects on the structure, function, and dynamics of membrane proteins.},

abstract = {Intramembrane proteolysis is a new paradigm in biology that controls signaling events throughout evolution. Hydrolysis of peptide bonds is thought to occur within the normally hydrophobic membrane environment, but insights into this unusual activity have been lacking because of difficulty in recapitulating activity in vitro. We have reconstituted intramembrane proteolysis with a pure recombinant substrate and rhomboid proteins in both detergent micelles and artificial membrane environments. Rhomboid proteins from diverse organisms including two model bacteria, a pathogen, an extremophile, and an animal were robustly active in pure form, proving that rhomboids are a new class of enzymes and do not require cofactors to catalyze intramembrane proteolysis. Rhomboid proteins directly recognized their substrates in vitro by the top of the substrate transmembrane domain, displaying specificity apparently reciprocal to that of gamma-secretase, the only other activity known to cleave type-I transmembrane domains. Rhomboid proteases represent a different evolutionary path to a serine protease mechanism and exhibited an inhibitor profile unlike other serine proteases. Intriguingly, activity was dramatically modulated by different membrane phospholipid environments, suggesting a mechanism for regulating these proteases. This analysis promises to help reveal the biochemical mechanisms and biological roles of this most widely conserved membrane protein family.},

abstract = {The beta-secretase, BACE, is a membrane spanning aspartic protease, which cleaves the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the first step of proteolytic processing leading to the formation of the neurotoxic beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta). Previous results have suggested that the regulation of beta-secretase and BACE access to APP is lipid dependent, and involves lipid rafts. Using the baculovirus expression system, we have expressed recombinant human full-length BACE in insect cells and purified milligram amounts to homogeneity. We have studied partitioning of fluorophor-conjugated BACE between the liquid ordered and disordered phases in giant (10-150 mum) unilamellar vesicles, and found approximately 20{\%} to associate with the raft-like, liquid-ordered phase; the fraction associated with liquid-ordered phase increased upon cross-linking of raft lipids. To examine involvement of individual lipid species in modulating BACE activity, we have reconstituted the purified BACE in large ( approximately 100 nm) unilamellar vesicles, and determined its specific activity in vesicles of various lipid compositions. We have identified 3 groups of lipids that stimulate proteolytic activity of BACE: 1) neutral glycosphingolipids (cerebrosides), 2) anionic glycerophospholipids, and 3) sterols (cholesterol).},

The results indicate that structural rearrangements in the binding pocket, albeit small, propagate toward the cytoplasmic side of the protein, and affect the dynamics of internal water molecules.

The crystallographic structure of SecYE?? from Methanococcus jannaschii revealed widespread distribution of mutations causing topogenesis defects, but not their molecular mechanisms. Based upon prolonged molecular dynamics simulations of wild-type M. jannaschii SecYE?? and an extensive sequence-conservation analysis, we show that the closed state of the translocon is stabilized by hydrogen-bonding interactions of numerous highly conserved amino acids. Perturbations induced by mutation at various locations are rapidly relayed to the plug segment that seals the wild-type closed-state translocon, leading to displacement and increased hydration of the plug. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

In order to understand GlpG dynamics and lipid interactions in a native-like environment, we have examined the molecular dynamics of wild-type and mutant GlpG in different membrane environments. The irregular shape and small hydrophobic thickness of the protein cause significant bilayer deformations that may be important for substrate entry into the active site. Hydrogen-bond interactions with lipids are paramount in protein orientation and dynamics. Mutations in the unusual L1 loop cause changes in protein dynamics and protein orientation that are relayed to the His-Ser catalytic dyad.

abstract = {The Vpu protein of HIV-1 antagonizes BST-2 (tetherin), a broad spectrum effector of the innate immune response to viral infection, by an intermolecular interaction that maps genetically to the $\alpha$-helical transmembrane domains (TMDs) of each protein. Here we utilize NMR spectroscopy to describe key features of the helix-helix pairing that underlies this interaction. The antagonism of BST-2 involves a sequence of three alanines and a tryptophan spaced at four residue intervals within the Vpu TMD helix. Responsiveness to Vpu involves bulky hydrophobic residues in the C-terminal region of the BST-2 TMD helix that likely fit between the alanines on the interactive face of Vpu. These aspects of Vpu and BST-2 form an anti-parallel, lipid-embedded helix-helix interface. Changes in human BST-2 that mimic sequences found in nonhuman primate orthologs unresponsive to Vpu change the tilt angle of the TMD in the lipid bilayer without abrogating its intrinsic ability to interact with Vpu. These data explain the mechanism by which HIV-1 evades a key aspect of innate immunity and the species specificity of Vpu using an anti-parallel helix-helix packing model.},

One key aspect of TMDs associated with various "checkposts" (i.e. organelles) of intracellular trafficking is their length. To explore possible linkages in organisms with varying "complexity" and differences in TMD lengths of membrane proteins associated with different organelles (such as Endoplasmic Reticulum, Golgi, Endosomes, Nucleus, Plasma Membrane), we analyzed {\~{}}70000 membrane protein sequences in over 300 genomes of fungi, plants, non-mammalian vertebrates and mammals. We report that as we move from simpler to complex organisms, variation in organellar TMD lengths decreases, especially compared to their respective plasma membranes, with increasing organismal complexity. This suggests an evolutionary pressure in modulating length of TMDs of membrane proteins with increasing complexity of communication between sub-cellular compartments. We also report functional applications of our findings by discovering remarkable distinctions in TMD lengths of membrane proteins associated with different intracellular transport pathways. Finally, we show that TMD lengths extracted from viral proteins can serve as somewhat weak indicators of viral replication sites in plant cells but very strong indicators of different entry pathways employed by animal viruses.},

Inactive EGFR can exist as both monomers and dimers, suggesting that the mechanism regulating EGFR activity may be subtle. The membrane itself may play a role but creates substantial difficulties for structural studies. Our molecular dynamics simulations of membrane-embedded EGFR suggest that, in ligand-bound dimers, the extracellular domains assume conformations favoring dimerization of the transmembrane helices near their N termini, dimerization of the juxtamembrane segments, and formation of asymmetric (active) kinase dimers. In ligand-free dimers, by holding apart the N termini of the transmembrane helices, the extracellular domains instead favor C-terminal dimerization of the transmembrane helices, juxtamembrane segment dissociation and membrane burial, and formation of symmetric (inactive) kinase dimers. Electrostatic interactions of EGFR's intracellular module with the membrane are critical in maintaining this coupling. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A new orbital debris engineering model, ORDEM2000, has been developed by the Orbital Debris Program Office at NASA Johnson Space Center. The new model uses a more rigorous mathematical method to derive debris populations from observation and measurement data. It also uses a direct approach to build the debris environment. This new approach eliminates several limitations and assumptions utilized in the previous model (ORDEM96). The new model provides a better description of the current debris environment than ORDEM96 does. It is expected that ORDEM2000 will soon replace ORDEM96 as the standard model to evaluate the debris risk for the International Space Station (ISS) and for future Shuttle missions.},

All signal sequences contain a hydrophobic core region, but, despite this, they show great variation in both overall length and amino acid sequence. Recently, it has become clear that this variation allows signal sequences to specify different modes of targeting and membrane insertion and even to perform functions after being cleaved from the parent protein. This review argues that signal sequences are not simply greasy peptides but sophisticated, multipurpose peptides containing a wealth of functional information.},

Although the anionic phospholipid phosphatidylserine is comparatively abundant, its contribution to the surface charge of individual cellular membranes is unknown, partly because of the lack of reagents to analyze its distribution in intact cells. We developed a biosensor to study the subcellular distribution of phosphatidylserine and found that it binds the cytosolic leaflets of the plasma membrane, as well as endosomes and lysosomes. The negative charge associated with the presence of phosphatidylserine directed proteins with moderately positive charge to the endocytic pathway. More strongly cationic proteins, normally associated with the plasma membrane, relocalized to endocytic compartments when the plasma membrane surface charge decreased on calcium influx.},

Recently, the dimeric conformation of the helical single-span transmembrane domains of HER/ErbB employing the relatively polar N-terminal motifs in a fashion permitting proper kinase activation was experimentally determined. Here we describe the EGFR transmembrane domain dimerization via an alternative weakly polar C-terminal motif A661xxxG665 presumably corresponding to the inactive receptor state. During association, the EGFR transmembrane helices undergo a structural adjustment with adaptation of inter-molecular polar and hydrophobic interactions depending upon the surrounding membrane properties that directly affect the transmembrane helix packing. This might imply that signal transduction through membrane and allosteric regulation are inclusively mediated by coupled protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions, elucidating paradoxically loose linkage between ligand binding and kinase activation.},

We have identified the cellular and molecular substrates for the taste of carbonation. By targeted genetic ablation and the silencing of synapses in defined populations of taste receptor cells, we demonstrated that the sour-sensing cells act as the taste sensors for carbonation, and showed that carbonic anhydrase 4, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored enzyme, functions as the principal CO2 taste sensor. Together, these studies reveal the basis of the taste of carbonation as well as the contribution of taste cells in the orosensory response to CO2.},

abstract = {SignificanceLysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), the prototypical "psychedelic," may be unique among psychoactive substances. In the decades that followed its discovery, the magnitude of its effect on science, the arts, and society was unprecedented. LSD produces profound, sometimes life-changing experiences in microgram doses, making it a particularly powerful scientific tool. Here we sought to examine its effects on brain activity, using cutting-edge and complementary neuroimaging techniques in the first modern neuroimaging study of LSD. Results revealed marked changes in brain blood flow, electrical activity, and network communication patterns that correlated strongly with the drugs hallucinatory and other consciousness-altering properties. These results have implications for the neurobiology of consciousness and for potential applications of LSD in psychological research. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is the prototypical psychedelic drug, but its effects on the human brain have never been studied before with modern neuroimaging. Here, three complementary neuroimaging techniques: arterial spin labeling (ASL), blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) measures, and magnetoencephalography (MEG), implemented during resting state conditions, revealed marked changes in brain activity after LSD that correlated strongly with its characteristic psychological effects. Increased visual cortex cerebral blood flow (CBF), decreased visual cortex alpha power, and a greatly expanded primary visual cortex (V1) functional connectivity profile correlated strongly with ratings of visual hallucinations, implying that intrinsic brain activity exerts greater influence on visual processing in the psychedelic state, thereby defining its hallucinatory quality. LSDs marked effects on the visual cortex did not significantly correlate with the drugs other characteristic effects on consciousness, however. Rather, decreased connectivity between the parahippocampus and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) correlated strongly with ratings of "ego-dissolution" and "altered meaning," implying the importance of this particular circuit for the maintenance of "self" or "ego" and its processing of "meaning." Strong relationships were also found between the different imaging metrics, enabling firmer inferences to be made about their functional significance. This uniquely comprehensive examination of the LSD state represents an important advance in scientific research with psychedelic drugs at a time of growing interest in their scientific and therapeutic value. The present results contribute important new insights into the characteristic hallucinatory and consciousness-altering properties of psychedelics that inform on how they can model certain pathological states and potentially treat others.},

abstract = {The determinants of transmembrane protein insertion orientation at the endoplasmic reticulum have been investigated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using variants of a Type III (naturally exofacial N terminus (Nexo)) transmembrane fusion protein derived from the N terminus of Ste2p, the alpha-factor receptor. Small positive and negative charges adjacent to the transmembrane segment had equal and opposite effects on orientation, and this effect was independent of N- or C-terminal location, consistent with a purely electrostatic interaction with response mechanisms. A 3:1 bias toward Nexo insertion, observed in the absence of a charge difference, was shown to reflect the Nexo bias conferred by longer transmembrane segments. Orientation correlated best with total hydrophobicity rather than length, but it was also strongly affected by the distribution of hydrophobicity within the transmembrane segment. The most hydrophobic terminus was preferentially translocated. Insertion orientation thus depends on integration of responses to at least three parameters: charge difference across a transmembrane segment, its total hydrophobicity, and its hydrophobicity gradient. Relative signal strengths were estimated, and consequences for topology prediction are discussed. Responses to transmembrane sequence may depend on protein-translocon interactions, but responses to charge difference may be mediated by the electrostatic field provided by anionic phospholipids.},

abstract = {Hybrid genes were constructed to express bifunctional hybrid proteins in which staphyloccal nuclease A with or without an amino-terminal OmpA signal sequence was fused with TEM beta-lactamase (at the carboxyl terminal side) using the signal peptide of the major outer membrane lipoprotein of Escherichia coli as an internal linker. The hybrid proteins were found to be inserted in the membrane. Orientation of the hybrid protein with the OmpA signal peptide showed that the nuclease was translocated into the periplasm and the beta-lactamase remained in the cytoplasm. This indicates that the cleavable OmpA signal peptide served as a secretory signal for nuclease and the internal lipoprotein signal served as the transmembrane anchor. In the absence of the OmpA signal sequence the topology of the hybrid protein was reversed indicating that the internal lipoprotein signal peptide initially served as the signal peptide for the secretion of the carboxy terminal beta-lactamase domain across the membrane and subsequently as a membrane anchoring signal. The role of charged amino acids in the translocation and transmembrane orientation of membrane proteins was also analysed by introducing charged amino acids to either or both sides of the internal lipoprotein signal sequence in the bifunctional hybrid proteins in the absence of the amino-terminal signal sequence. Introduction of two lysine residues at the carboxy-terminal side of the internal signal sequence reversed the topology of the transmembrane protein by translocating the amino-terminal nuclease domain across the membrane, leaving the carboxyl terminal beta-lactamase domain in the cytoplasm. When three more lysine residues were added to the amino-terminal side of the internal signal sequence of the same construct the membrane topology flipped back to the original orientation. A similar reversion of the topology could be obtained by introducing negatively charged residues at the amino-terminal side of the internal signal sequence. Present results demonstrate for the first time that a bifunctional transmembrane protein can be engineered to assume either of the two opposite orientations and that charge balance around the transmembrane domain is a major factor in controlling the topology of a transmembrane protein.},

Here, we show that a negatively charged aspartic acid situated close to a positively charged lysine can attenuate both of these effects in a position-specific manner, suggesting that intra- or intermolecular charge pairing can modulate the interactions between positively charged residues in the nascent chain and parts of the secretory machinery or membrane phospholipids. These observations further underscore the importance of charged amino acids during protein translocation and membrane protein assembly.},

Whereas some critical residues are conserved in both proteins, there are major differences between the two proteins which may reflect different functions for this region. Replacement of R317, Y313, or P341 by a number of other amino acids destroyed the PheP function. An R317E-E234R double mutant exhibited low levels of PheP transport activity, indicating that there is a possible interaction between these two residues in the wild-type protein. E234 is highly conserved in members of the superfamily of amino acid-polyamine-organocation transporters and also is critical for PheP function in the wild-type protein. Second-site suppressors were isolated for mutants with mutations in E234, Y313, R317, and P341. Most suppressor mutations were found to cluster towards the extracellular face of spans III, IX, and X. Some mutations, such as changes at M116, were able to suppress each of the primary changes at positions E234, Y313, R317, and P341 but were unable to restore function to a number of other primary mutants.

I., Kuhn, A., and Dalbey, R. E. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 938-943). We now show that when the first transmembrane segment lacks a strong hydrophobic character, the pmf is required for translocation. In addition, we find that the amino-terminal acidic residue proximal to the transmembrane domain plays a critical role in pmf-dependent amino-terminal translocation. Moreover, the pmf is required to hold the amino-terminal domain in the periplasm to prevent it from slipping such that the amino terminus is no longer exposed to the periplasm. In all cases, translocation occurs under conditions in which the function of the Sec machinery is impaired. These studies show that the low hydrophobicity of the first apolar domain (the translocation signal) can be compensated for by a negative charge in the amino-terminal region, upon which the pmf acts.},

abstract = {We have studied the membrane insertion of ProW, an Escherichia coli inner membrane protein with seven transmembrane segments and a large periplasmic N-terminal tail, into endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived dog pancreas microsomes. Strikingly, significant levels of N-tail translocation is seen only when a minimum of four of the transmembrane segments are present; for constructs with fewer transmembrane segments, the N-tail remains mostly nontranslocated and the majority of the molecules adopt an 'inverted' topology where normally nontranslocated parts are translocated and vice versa. N-tail translocation can also be promoted by shortening of the N-tail and by the addition of positively charged residues immediately downstream of the first transmembrane segment. We conclude that as many as four consecutive transmembrane segments may be collectively involved in determining membrane protein topology in the ER and that the effects of downstream sequence determinants may vary depending on the size and charge of the N-tail. We also provide evidence to suggest that the Prow N-tail is translocated across the ER membrane in a C-to-N-terminal direction.},

In general, we find that positively charged residues have similar effects on the membrane topology in both systems when they are placed in the N-terminal tail but that the effects of charged residues in internal loops clearly differ.

In this paper, we report a systematic comparison of the effects of positively (Arg, Lys, His) as well as negatively (Asp, Glu) charged residues on the membrane topology of a model Escherichia coli inner membrane protein. Our results show that positive charge is indeed the major factor determining the transmembrane topology, with Arg and Lys being of nearly equal efficiency. His, although normally a very weak topological determinant, can be potentiated by a lowering of the cytoplasmic pH. Asp and Glu affect the topology to similar extents and only when present in very high numbers.},

abstract = {Most eukaryotic membrane proteins are cotranslationally integrated into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by the Sec61 translocation complex. They are targeted to the translocon by hydrophobic signal sequences, which induce the translocation of either their N- or their C-terminal sequence. Signal sequence orientation is largely determined by charged residues flanking the apolar sequence (the positive-inside rule), folding properties of the N-terminal segment, and the hydrophobicity of the signal. Recent in vivo experiments suggest that N-terminal signals initially insert into the translocon head-on to yield a translocated N-terminus. Driven by a local electrical potential, the signal may invert its orientation and translocate the C-terminal sequence. Increased hydrophobicity slows down inversion by stabilizing the initial bound state. In vitro cross-linking studies indicate that signals rapidly contact lipids upon entering the translocon. Together with the recent crystal structure of the homologous SecYEbeta translocation complex of Methanococcus jannaschii, which did not reveal an obvious hydrophobic binding site for signals within the pore, a model emerges in which the translocon allows the lateral partitioning of hydrophobic segments between the aqueous pore and the lipid membrane. Signals may return into the pore for reorientation until translation is terminated. Subsequent transmembrane segments in multispanning proteins behave similarly and contribute to the overall topology of the protein.},

To study the role of charged residues in determining the membrane topology, the insertion of mutants of the asialoglycoprotein receptor H1, a single-spanning protein with a cytoplasmic amino terminus, was analyzed in transfected COS-7 cells. When the charged amino acids flanking the hydrophobic signal were mutated to residues of opposite charge, half the polypeptides inserted with the inverted orientation. When, in addition, the amino-terminal domain of the mutant protein was truncated, approximately 90{\%} of the polypeptides acquired the inverted topology. The transmembrane orientation appears to be primarily determined by the charges flanking the signal sequence but is modulated by the domains to be translocated.},

We assessed the function of the positive charges downstream of the hydrophobic segment using synaptotagmin II. The positive charges were systematically replaced with non-charged residues. Although the original TM segment translocated the N terminus, the topology was inverted, depending on the mutations. Orientation was affected in mutants in which 6 Lys were shifted downstream, even when the 6 Lys were 25 residues from the hydrophobic segment. The Lys was functionally replaced by Arg, but not by Asp or Glu. The timing of action during polypeptide elongation indicated that the Lys functions at the ribosome exit sites. We suggest that the commitment of the TM segment to a particular orientation is influenced by far downstream parts of the polypeptide chain and that the positive charges are decoded after exiting the ribosome.},

To establish the structural requirements for the function of signal and signal-anchor sequences, we constructed chimeric proteins containing artificial topogenic sequences in which the N-terminal net charge and the length of the hydrophobic segment were systematically altered. Utilizing an in vitro translation-translocation system, we found that hydrophobic segments consisting of 7-10 leucine residues functioned as signal sequences whereas segments with 12-15 leucine residues showed different topogenic functions, behaving as signal sequences or P-450-type signal-anchor sequences, depending on the N-terminal charge. From these observations, we propose that the function of N-terminal topogenic sequences depends on a balance between the N-terminal charge and the length of the following hydrophobic segment.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The dearth of structural data on alpha-helical membrane proteins (MPs) has hampered thus far the development of reliable knowledge-based potentials that can be used for automatic prediction of transmembrane (TM) protein structure. While algorithms for identifying TM segments are available, modeling of the TM domains of alpha-helical MPs involves assembling the segments into a bundle. This requires the correct assignment of the buried and lipid-exposed faces of the TM domains. RESULTS: A recent increase in the number of crystal structures of alpha-helical MPs has enabled an analysis of the lipid-exposed surfaces and the interiors of such molecules on the basis of structure, rather than sequence alone. Together with a conservation criterion that is based on previous observations that conserved residues are mostly found in the interior of MPs, the bias of certain residue types to be preferably buried or exposed is proposed as a criterion for predicting the lipid-exposed and interior faces of TMs. Applications to known structures demonstrates 80{\%} accuracy of this prediction algorithm. AVAILABILITY: The algorithm used for the predictions is implemented in the ProperTM Web server (http://icb.med.cornell.edu/services/propertm/start).},

abstract = {With synthetic gene services, molecular cloning is as easy as ordering a pizza. However choosing the right RNA code for efficient protein production is less straightforward, more akin to deciding on the pizza toppings. The possibility to choose synonymous codons in the gene sequence has ignited a discussion that dates back 50 years: Does synonymous codon use matter? Recent studies indicate that replacement of particular codons for synonymous codons can improve expression in homologous or heterologous hosts, however it is not always successful. Furthermore it is increasingly apparent that membrane protein biogenesis can be codon-sensitive. Single synonymous codon substitutions can influence mRNA stability, mRNA structure, translational initiation, translational elongation and even protein folding. Synonymous codon substitutions therefore need to be carefully evaluated when membrane proteins are engineered for higher production levels and further studies are needed to fully understand how to select the codons that are optimal for higher production. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Utilizing genetic screens, we identified several mutations that induced gain-of-function or loss-of-function phenotypes in vivo. Mutants that exhibited the most severe phenotypes were further characterized using electrophysiological techniques and chemical modifications of the substituted cysteines. Our results verify the importance of residues in the putative primary gate in the first transmembrane domain, corroborate other residues previously noted as critical for normal function, and identify new ones.

abstract = {An algorithm has been developed which identifies ??-helices involved in the interactions of membrane proteins with lipid bilayers and which distinguishes them from helices in soluble proteins. The membrane-associated helices are then classified with the aid of the hydrophobic moment plot, on which the hydrophobic moment of each helix is plotted as a function of its hydrophobicity. The magnitude of hydrophobic moment measures the amphiphilicity of the helix (and hence its tendency to seek a surface between hydrophobic and hydrophilic phases), and the hydrophobicity measures its affinity for the membrane interior. Segments of membrane proteins in ??-helices tend to fall in one of three regions of a hydrophobic moment plot: (1) monomeric transmembrane anchors (class I HLA transmembrane sequences) lie in the region of highest hydrophobicity and smallest hydrophobic moment; (2) helices presumed to be paired (such as the transmembrane M segments of surface immunoglobulins) and helices which are bundled together in membranes (such as bacteriorhodopsin) fall in the adjacent region with higher hydrophobic moment and smaller hydrophobicity; and (3) helices from surface-seeking proteins (such as melittin) fall in the region with still higher hydrophobic moment. ??-Helices from globular proteins mainly fall in a region of lower mean hydrophobicity and hydrophobic moment. Application of these methods to the sequence of diphtheria toxin suggests four transmembrane helices and a surface-seeking helix in fragment B, the moiety known to have transmembrane function. ?? 1984.},

Although we initially detectedPHVin a wide range of clinical samples, with all strains sharing?99{\%} nucleotide and amino acid identity with each other and with NIH-CQV, the exact origin of the virus was eventually traced to contaminated silica-binding spin columns used for nucleic acid extraction. Definitive confirmation of the origin of PHV, and presumably NIH-CQV, was obtained by in-depth analyses of water eluted through contaminated spin columns. Analysis of environmental metagenome li- braries detectedPHVsequences in coastal marine waters of North America, suggesting that a potential association betweenPHV and diatoms (algae) that generate the silica matrix used in the spin columns may have resulted in inadvertent viral contamina- tion during manufacture. The confirmation of PHV/NIH-CQV as laboratory reagent contaminants and not bona fide infectious agents of humans underscores the rigorous approach needed to establish the validity of new viral genomes discovered by next- generation sequencing.

abstract = {Seronegative hepatitis--non-A, non-B, non-C, non-D, non-E hepatitis--is poorly characterized but strongly associated with serious complications. We collected 92 sera specimens from patients with non-A-E hepatitis in Chongqing, China between 1999 and 2007. Ten sera pools were screened by Solexa deep sequencing. We discovered a 3,780-bp contig present in all 10 pools that yielded BLASTx E scores of 7e-05-0.008 against parvoviruses. The complete sequence of the in silico-assembled 3,780-bp contig was confirmed by gene amplification of overlapping regions over almost the entire genome, and the virus was provisionally designated NIH-CQV. Further analysis revealed that the contig was composed of two major ORFs. By protein BLAST, ORF1 and ORF2 were most homologous to the replication-associated protein of bat circovirus and the capsid protein of porcine parvovirus, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that NIH-CQV is located at the interface of Parvoviridae and Circoviridae. Prevalence of NIH-CQV in patients was determined by quantitative PCR. Sixty-three of 90 patient samples (70{\%}) were positive, but all those from 45 healthy controls were negative. Average virus titer in the patient specimens was 1.05 e4 copies/¬µL. Specific antibodies against NIH-CQV were sought by immunoblotting. Eighty-four percent of patients were positive for IgG, and 31{\%} were positive for IgM; in contrast, 78{\%} of healthy controls were positive for IgG, but all were negative for IgM. Although more work is needed to determine the etiologic role of NIH-CQV in human disease, our data indicate that a parvovirus-like virus is highly prevalent in a cohort of patients with non-A-E hepatitis.},

Here, we describe a new high-throughput screening algorithm developed to classify antibody molecules based on their propensity to aggregate. The tool, constructed and validated on experimental aggregation data for over 500 antibodies, is able to discern molecules with a high aggregation propensity as defined by experimental criteria relevant to bioprocessing and manufacturing of these molecules. Furthermore, we show how this tool can be combined with other computational approaches during early drug development to select molecules with reduced risk of aggregation and optimal developability properties.},

Evidence of an epizootic of Zika virus at the Zika Forest near Entebbe is described which occurred in two episodes, the first (in 1969) apparently following the build-up of non-immune monkey populations since a previous epizootic of 1962???1963 and the second (in 1970) when Aedes africanus biting densities rose. This was followed only 18 months later by an intensive epizootic of YF virus, contradictory to the hypothesis that Zika virus alone would suppress subsequent epizootics of YF virus in nature, at least when redtail monkeys are involved. Conclusions are finally reviewed in the light of more recent evidence of transovarial flavivirus transmission in mosquitoes, pointing out that phlebotomine sandflies also require fresh attention. ?? 1982 Oxford University Press.},

In the present study, we used a modified culture protocol that included plating larger volumes of urine, incubation under varied atmospheric conditions, and prolonged incubation times to demonstrate that many of the organisms identified in urine by 16S rRNA gene sequencing are, in fact, cultivable using an expanded quantitative urine culture (EQUC) protocol. Sixty-five urine specimens (from 41 patients with overactive bladder and 24 controls) were examined using both the standard and EQUC culture techniques. Fifty-two of the 65 urine samples (80{\%}) grew bacterial species using EQUC, while the majority of these (48/52 [92{\%}]) were reported as no growth at 10(3) CFU/ml by the clinical microbiology laboratory using the standard urine culture protocol. Thirty-five different genera and 85 different species were identified by EQUC. The most prevalent genera isolated were Lactobacillus (15{\%}), followed by Corynebacterium (14.2{\%}), Streptococcus (11.9{\%}), Actinomyces (6.9{\%}), and Staphylococcus (6.9{\%}).

abstract = {Background Contrary to dogma that urine is sterile in the absence of a clinical urinary tract infection (UTI); our research team and others have recently shown the existence of a urinary microbiota in individuals with and without lower urinary tract symptoms. With the knowledge that the lower urinary tract possesses its own unique microbiota, we are exploring potential causes for lower urinary tract syndromes, such as overactive bladder syndrome (OAB), a disorder affecting {\~{}}15{\%} of adult women. OAB is characterized by symptoms of urinary urgency, often with frequency and urgency incontinence, nocturia and a negative urine culture. {\~{}}40-50{\%} of OAB patients do not respond to conventional anti-muscarinic drug treatment. One possible explanation for this lack of treatment response is a dysbiotic urinary microbiota. Materials Following Loyola institutional review board (IRB) approval for all phases of this project, women undergoing OAB treatment and a comparison group of women undergoing benign gynecologic surgery (controls) gave research consent for the collection and analysis of their urine. Urine samples from OAB (42) and control (42) were examined by both standard and expanded quantitative urine culture (EQUC) techniques. Matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was used to classify bacterial isolates. Results 60 of the 84 urine specimens (71.4{\%}) grew bacteria. However, 90{\%} of these specimens were deemed ‚ÄúNo Growth‚Äù by the standard urine culture technique, highlighting its limitations. OAB patients had more diverse urinary microbiota than did control patients: a total of 217 bacterial isolates from 77 different genera were isolated from OAB patients, while 66 bacterial isolates from 33 different genera were isolated from control patients. Organisms isolated solely from OAB patient urines included Actinobaculum schaalii, Aerococcus urinae, Arthrobacter cumminsii, and Oligella urethralis; each has been reported to cause UTI. Conclusions Women with OAB have more diverse urinary microbiota than control patients. This diversity and/or the presence of specific organisms could contribute to OAB symptoms.},

@article{Liu2006,
abstract = {Motivated by ongoing efforts to understand the mechanism of membrane protein crystallogenesis and transport in the lipidic cubic phase, the nature of the interaction between tryptophan and the bilayer/aqueous interface of the cubic phase has been investigated. The association was quantified by partitioning measurements that enabled the free energy of interaction to be determined. Temperature-dependent partitioning was used to parse the association free energy change into its enthalpic and entropic components. As has been observed with tryptophan derivatives interacting with glycerophospholipid bilayers in vesicles, tryptophan partitioning in the cubic phase is enthalpy driven. This is in contrast to partitioning into apolar solvents, which exhibits the classic hydrophobic effect whose hallmark is a favorable entropy change. These results with tryptophan are somewhat surprising given the simplicity, homogeneity, and curvature of the interface that prevails in the case of the cubic phase. Nevertheless, the interaction between tryptophan and the mesophase is very slight as revealed by its low partition coefficient. Additional evidence in support of the interaction was obtained by electronic absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and fluorescence quenching. Partitioning proved insensitive to the lipid composition of the membrane, examined by doping with glycerophospholipids. However, the interaction could be manipulated in meaningful ways by the inclusion in the aqueous medium of salt, glycerol, or urea. The effects seen with tryptophan were amplified rationally when measurements were repeated using tryptophan alkyl esters and with tryptophan peptides of increasing length. These findings are interpreted in the context of the insertion, folding, and function of proteins in membranes.},

abstract = {Abstract: One of the ubiquitous features of membrane proteins is the preference of tryptophan and tyrosine residues for membrane surfaces that presumably arises from enhanced stability due to distinct interfacial interactions. The physical basis for this preference is widely believed to arise from amphipathic interactions related to imino group hydrogen bonding and/or dipole interactions. We have examined these and other possibilities for tryptophan's interfacial preference by using 1H magic angle spinning (MAS) chemical shift measurements, two-dimensional (2D) nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (2D-NOESY) 1H MAS NMR, and solid state 2H NMR to study the interactions of four tryptophan analogues with phosphatidylcholine membranes. We find that the analogues reside in the vicinity of the glycerol group where they all cause similar modest changes in acyl chain organization and that hydrocarbon penetration was not increased by reduction of hydrogen bonding or electric dipole interaction ability. These observations rule out simple amphipathic or dipolar interactions as the physical basis for the interfacial preference. More likely, the preference is dominated by tryptophan's flat rigid shape that limits access to the hydrocarbon core and its electronic structure and associated quadrupolar moment (aromaticity) that favor residing in the electrostatically complex interface environment.},

Previous studies on the integration of model transmembrane segments into the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER) have provided a rather detailed quantitative picture of the relation between amino acid sequence and membrane-integration propensity for proteins targeted to the Sec61 translocon. We have now carried out a comparative study of the integration of Nout-Cin-orientated 19-residue-long polypeptide segments into the ER of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that the 'threshold hydrophobicity' required for insertion into the ER membrane is very similar in S. cerevisiae and in mammalian cells. Further, when comparing the contributions to the apparent free energy of membrane insertion of the 20 natural amino acids between the S. cerevisiae and the mammalian ER, we find that the two scales are strongly correlated but that the absolute difference between the most hydrophobic and most hydrophilic residues is ‚àº 2-fold smaller in S. cerevisiae. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Setting Functional imaging unit and department of clinical physiology, nuclear medicine and PET in Denmark. Participants 10 healthy people from the Copenhagen area who routinely celebrate Christmas and 10 healthy people living in the same area who have no Christmas traditions. Main outcome measures Brain activation unique to the group with Christmas traditions during visual stimulation with images with a Christmas theme. Methods Functional brain scans optimised for detection of the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response were performed while participants viewed a series of images with Christmas themes interleaved with neutral images having similar characteristics but containing nothing that symbolises Christmas. After scanning, participants answered a questionnaire about their Christmas traditions and the associations they have with Christmas. Brain activation maps from scanning were analysed for Christmas related activation in the ‚ÄúChristmas‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-Christmas‚Äù groups individually. Subsequently, differences between the two groups were calculated to determine Christmas specific brain activation. Results Significant clusters of increased BOLD activation in the sensory motor cortex, the premotor and primary motor cortex, and the parietal lobule (inferior and superior) were found in scans of people who celebrate Christmas with positive associations compared with scans in a group having no Christmas traditions and neutral associations. These cerebral areas have been associated with spirituality, somatic senses, and recognition of facial emotion among many other functions. Conclusions There is a ‚ÄúChristmas spirit network‚Äù in the human brain comprising several cortical areas. This network had a significantly higher activation in a people who celebrate Christmas with positive associations as opposed to a people who have no Christmas traditions and neutral associations. Further research is necessary to understand this and other potential holiday circuits in the brain. Although merry and intriguing, these findings should be interpreted with caution.},

abstract = {Objective To investigate whether language used in science abstracts can skew towards the use of strikingly positive and negative words over time. Design Retrospective analysis of all scientific abstracts in PubMed between 1974 and 2014. Methods The yearly frequencies of positive, negative, and neutral words (25 preselected words in each category), plus 100 randomly selected words were normalised for the total number of abstracts. Subanalyses included pattern quantification of individual words, specificity for selected high impact journals, and comparison between author affiliations within or outside countries with English as the official majority language. Frequency patterns were compared with 4{\%} of all books ever printed and digitised by use of Google Books Ngram Viewer. Main outcome measures Frequencies of positive and negative words in abstracts compared with frequencies of words with a neutral and random connotation, expressed as relative change since 1980. Results The absolute frequency of positive words increased from 2.0{\%} (1974-80) to 17.5{\%} (2014), a relative increase of 880{\%} over four decades. All 25 individual positive words contributed to the increase, particularly the words "robust," "novel," "innovative," and "unprecedented," which increased in relative frequency up to 15 000{\%}. Comparable but less pronounced results were obtained when restricting the analysis to selected journals with high impact factors. Authors affiliated to an institute in a non-English speaking country used significantly more positive words. Negative word frequencies increased from 1.3{\%} (1974-80) to 3.2{\%} (2014), a relative increase of 257{\%}. Over the same time period, no apparent increase was found in neutral or random word use, or in the frequency of positive word use in published books. Conclusions Our lexicographic analysis indicates that scientific abstracts are currently written with more positive and negative words, and provides an insight into the evolution of scientific writing. Apparently scientists look on the bright side of research results. But whether this perception fits reality should be questioned.},

abstract = {Abstract Objective To evaluate doctors' coffee consumption at work and differences between specialties. Design Single centre retrospective cohort study. Setting Large teaching hospital in Switzerland. Participants 766 qualified doctors (425 men, 341 women) from all medical specialties (201 internal medicine, 76 general surgery, 67 anaesthetics, 54 radiology, 48 orthopaedics, 43 gynaecology, 36 neurology, 23 neurosurgery, 96 other specialties). Data source Staff purchasing history from staff canteens' electronic payment system linked to separate anonymised personal data from the human resource database. Main outcome measure Numbers of coffees purchased per person per year. Results 84{\%} (644) of doctors purchased coffee at one of the hospital canteens. 70 772 coffees were consumed by doctors in 2014. There was a significant association between specialty and yearly coffee purchasing (F=12.45; P{\textless}0.01). On average orthopaedic surgeons purchased the most coffee per person per year (mean 189, SD 136) followed by radiologists (177, SD 191) and general surgeons (167, SD 138). Anaesthetists purchased the least coffee (39, SD 48). Male doctors bought significantly more coffees per person per year (128 (SD 140) v 86 (SD 86), t=‚àí4.66, P{\textless}0.01) and twice as many espressos as female doctors (mean 27 (SD 46) v 10 (SD 19), t=‚àí6.54, P{\textless}0.01). Hierarchical position was associated with coffee purchasing (F=4.55; P=0.04). Senior consultants ({\textgreater}5 years' experience) bought most coffees per person per year (140, SD 169) and junior doctors and registrars bought fewest (95, SD 85). Propensity of buying rounds also increased with hierarchical position ($\chi$2=556.24; P{\textless}0.01), with heads of departments buying more rounds than junior doctors (30{\%} v 15{\%}). Conclusions Doctors commonly use coffee as a stimulant. Substantial variation exists between specialties. Surgeons drink notably more coffee than physicians, with orthopaedic surgeons consuming the greatest amount in the communal cafeteria setting, though this might reflect social tendencies rather than caffeine dependency. Hierarchical position is positively correlated with coffee consumption and generosity with regard to buying rounds of coffee.},

Main outcome measures The proportions of female leaders and moustachioed leaders across institutions and specialties (n=20). Additionally, the moustache index: the proportion of women compared with the proportion of moustaches, analyzed with multinomial logistic regression models. Results Women accounted for 13{\%} (137/1018) of department leaders at the top 50 NIH funded medical schools in the US. Moustachioed leaders accounted for 19{\%} (190/1018). The proportion of female department leaders ranged from 0{\%} (0/20) to 26{\%} (5/19) across institutions and 0{\%} (0/53) to 36{\%} (19/53) across specialties. Only seven institutions and five specialties had more than 20{\%} of female department leaders. The overall moustache index of all academic medical departments studied was 0.72 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.58 to 0.90; P=0.004). Only six of 20 specialties had more women than moustaches (moustache index {\textgreater}1). Conclusions Moustachioed individuals significantly outnumber women as leaders of medical departments in the US. We believe that every department and institution should strive for a moustache index ‚â•1.

abstract = {Introduction: Male homosexual behavior carries a high risk of transmitting sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Ignorance regarding the associated high risk, indulgence inspite of no natural homosexual orientation and not using protective barrier methods can affect the sexual health of adolescents and adults. Aim: (1) To assess the proportion of men who have sex with men (MSM) having a natural homosexual orientation compared to those who had acquired the homosexual behavior initially under various circumstances (such as due to certain misconceptions, fear of having heterosexual contact, peer pressure, and influence of alcohol). (2) To assess the level of awareness regarding increased risk of transmission of STIs associated with homosexual behavior and regarding protective barrier methods. Materials and Methods: After obtaining consent from the subjects, questionnaire - based interview used for obtaining data for this observational (cross-sectional) study. Results: (1) Of the 50 subjects, only about 25{\%} had interest in homosexual behavior prior to initial episode. (2) About 50{\%} subjects indulged in homosexual behavior due to lack/fear of having heterosexual contact. (3) About 60{\%} subjects believed that homosexual behavior carried relatively lower risk of acquiring STIs and 68{\%} subjects have had unprotected contact. (4) About 70{\%} subjects had only acquired this behavior and nearly 60{\%} subjects were interested in heterosexual marriage and not interested in further homosexual behavior. Conclusion: (1) Homosexuality is a natural orientation in some and an acquired behavior in the rest. (2) If homosexual behavior is acquired, due to misconceptions, then imparting sex education and awareness regarding involved risks, and the importance of protective barrier methods will prevent ignorance driven behavior. For those with natural homosexual orientation, the importance of protective barrier methods in homosexual behavior needs emphasis.},

abstract = {Hydrophobicity analyses applied to databases of soluble and transmembrane (TM) proteins of known structure were used to resolve total genomic hydrophobicity profiles into (helical) TM sequences and mainly "subhydrophobic" soluble components. This information was used to define a refined "hydrophobicity"-type TM sequence prediction scale that should approach the theoretical limit of accuracy. The refinement procedure involved adjusting scale values to eliminate differences between the average amino acid composition of populations TM and soluble sequences of equal hydrophobicity, a required property of a scale having maximum accuracy. Application of this procedure to different hydrophobicity scales caused them to collapse to essentially a single TM tendency scale. As expected, when different scales were compared, the TM tendency scale was the most accurate at predicting TM sequences. It was especially highly correlated (r = 0.95) to the biological hydrophobicity scale, derived experimentally from the percent TM conformation formed by artificial sequences passing though the translocon. It was also found that resolution of total genomic sequence data into TM and soluble components could be used to define the percent probability that a sequence with a specific hydrophobicity value forms a TM segment. Application of the TM tendency scale to whole genomic data revealed an overlap of TM and soluble sequences in the "semihydrophobic" range. This raises the possibility that a significant number of proteins have sequences that can switch between TM and non-TM states. Such proteins may exist in moonlighting forms having properties very different from those of the predominant conformation.},

Nascent polypeptides emerging from a translating ribosome are either transported across or inserted into the membrane via the ribosome-bound Sec61 channel. Here, we report structures of a mammalian ribosome-Sec61 complex in both idle and translating states, determined to 3.4 and 3.9 ?? resolution. The data sets permit building of a near-complete atomic model of the mammalian ribosome, visualization of A/P and P/E hybrid-state tRNAs, and analysis of a nascent polypeptide in the exit tunnel. Unprecedented chemical detail is observed for both the ribosome-Sec61 interaction and the conformational state of Sec61 upon ribosome binding. Comparison of the maps from idle and translating complexes suggests how conformational changes to the Sec61 channel could facilitate translocation of a secreted polypeptide. The high-resolution structure of the mammalian ribosome-Sec61 complex provides a valuable reference for future functional and structural studies. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Many proteins are translocated through the SecY channel in bacteria and archaea and through the related Sec61 channel in eukaryotes. The channel has an hourglass shape with a narrow constriction approximately halfway across the membrane, formed by a pore ring of amino acids. While the cytoplasmic cavity of the channel is empty, the extracellular cavity is filled with a short helix called the plug, which moves out of the way during protein translocation. The mechanism by which the channel transports large polypeptides and yet prevents the passage of small molecules, such as ions or metabolites, has been controversial. Here, we have addressed this issue in intact Escherichia coli cells by testing the permeation of small molecules through wild-type and mutant SecY channels, which are either in the resting state or contain a defined translocating polypeptide chain. We show that in the resting state, the channel is sealed by both the pore ring and the plug domain. During translocation, the pore ring forms a 'gasket-like' seal around the polypeptide chain, preventing the permeation of small molecules. The structural conservation of the channel in all organisms indicates that this may be a universal mechanism by which the membrane barrier is maintained during protein translocation.},

These boxes were kept under continuous covert surveillance, with the time recorded when each chocolate was eaten.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Median survival time of a chocolate.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: 191 out of 258 (74{\%}) chocolates were observed being eaten. The mean total observation period was 254 minutes (95{\%} confidence interval 179 to 329). The median survival time of a chocolate was 51 minutes (39 to 63). The model of chocolate consumption was non-linear, with an initial rapid rate of consumption that slowed with time. An exponential decay model best fitted these findings (model R(2)=0.844, P{\textless}0.001), with a survival half life (time taken for 50{\%} of the chocolates to be eaten) of 99 minutes. The mean time taken to open a box of chocolates from first appearance on the ward was 12 minutes (95{\%} confidence interval 0 to 24). Quality Street chocolates survived longer than Roses chocolates (hazard ratio for survival of Roses v Quality Street 0.70, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.53 to 0.93, P=0.014). The highest percentages of chocolates were consumed by healthcare assistants (28{\%}) and nurses (28{\%}), followed by doctors (15{\%}).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: From our observational study, chocolate survival in a hospital ward was relatively short, and was modelled well by an exponential decay model. Roses chocolates were preferentially consumed to Quality Street chocolates in a ward setting. Chocolates were consumed primarily by healthcare assistants and nurses, followed by doctors.

We also discuss the recent, antibiotic-era, evolution of the serine $\beta$-lactamases in response to the clinical use of $\beta$-lactam antibiotics. We also discuss a method that is being used to predict the future evolution of $\beta$-lactamases in response to selection with new drugs. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The catalytic site/mechanism and the corresponding structural elements were characterized for these proteins based on the available structure of the Bacillus zinc-dependent beta-lactamase. Based on pair-wise sequence and phylogenetic analysis an evolutionary classification for enzymes of this fold was developed and discussed in terms of implications for substrate specificity.

In this study, we developed one of the first proteomic approaches applied to mollusk shell in order to characterise the calcifying matrix proteins. The insoluble organic matrix, purified after demineralisation of the shell powder, was digested with trypsin enzyme, and separated on nano-LC, prior to nanospray quadrupole/time-of-flight analysis. MS/MS spectra were searched against the above 220,000 EST sequences available in the public database for Crassostrea. Using this approach, we were able to identify partial or full-length sequence transcripts that encode eight novel shell matrix proteins.},

@article{Suzuki2015,
abstract = {Many prokaryotes lack a tRNA synthetase to attach asparagine to its cognate tRNA(Asn), and instead synthesize asparagine from tRNA(Asn)-bound aspartate. This conversion involves two enzymes: a nondiscriminating aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (ND-AspRS) that forms Asp-tRNA(Asn), and a heterotrimeric amidotransferase GatCAB that amidates Asp-tRNA(Asn) to form Asn-tRNA(Asn) for use in protein synthesis. ND-AspRS, GatCAB, and tRNA(Asn) may assemble in an ‚àº400-kDa complex, known as the Asn-transamidosome, which couples the two steps of asparagine biosynthesis in space and time to yield Asn-tRNA(Asn). We report the 3.7-{\AA} resolution crystal structure of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Asn-transamidosome, which represents the most common machinery for asparagine biosynthesis in bacteria. We show that, in contrast to a previously described archaeal-type transamidosome, a bacteria-specific GAD domain of ND-AspRS provokes a principally new architecture of the complex. Both tRNA(Asn) molecules in the transamidosome simultaneously serve as substrates and scaffolds for the complex assembly. This architecture rationalizes an elevated dynamic and a greater turnover of ND-AspRS within bacterial-type transamidosomes, and possibly may explain a different evolutionary pathway of GatCAB in organisms with bacterial-type vs. archaeal-type Asn-transamidosomes. Importantly, because the two-step pathway for Asn-tRNA(Asn) formation evolutionarily preceded the direct attachment of Asn to tRNA(Asn), our structure also may reflect the mechanism by which asparagine was initially added to the genetic code.},

In this study, we investigated the gene expression of PriB in Klebsiella pneumoniae (KpPriB) and characterized the gene product through crystal structural and functional analyses. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis (Q-PCR) indicated that the 104-aa priB was expressed in K. pneumoniae with a C(T) value of 22.4. The crystal structure of KpPriB (Protein Data Bank entry: 4APV) determined at a resolution of 2.1 {\AA} was similar to that of Escherichia coli PriB (EcPriB). KpPriB formed a single complex with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) of different lengths, suggesting a highly cooperative process. Structure-based mutational analysis revealed that substitution at K18, F42, R44, W47, K82, K84, or K89 but not R34 in KpPriB had a significant effect on both ssDNA and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) binding. Based on these findings, the known ssDNA interaction sites of PriB were expanded to include R44 and F42, thus allowing nucleic acids to wrap around the whole PriB protein.},

abstract = {A novel folding motif has been observed in four different proteins which bind oligonucleotides or oligosaccharides: staphylococcal nuclease, anticodon binding domain of asp-tRNA synthetase and B-subunits of heat-labile enterotoxin and verotoxin-1. The common fold of the four proteins, which we call the OB-fold, has a five-stranded beta-sheet coiled to form a closed beta-barrel. This barrel is capped by an alpha-helix located between the third and fourth strands. The barrel-helix frameworks can be superimposed with r.m.s. deviations of 1.4-2.2 A, but no similarities can be observed in the corresponding alignment of the four sequences. The nucleotide or sugar binding sites, known for three of the four proteins, are located in nearly the same position in each protein: on the side surface of the beta-barrel, where three loops come together. Here we describe the determinants of the OB-fold, based on an analysis of all four structures. These proposed determinants explain how very different sequences adopt the OB-fold. They also suggest a reinterpretation of the controversial structure of gene 5 ssDNA binding protein, which exhibits some topological and functional similarities with the OB-fold proteins.},

The environments are described by: (i) the area of the residue buried in the protein and inaccessible to solvent; (ii) the fraction of side-chain area that is covered by polar atoms (O and N); and (iii) the local secondary structure. Examples of this 3D profile method are presented for four families of proteins: the globins, cyclic AMP (adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate) receptor-like proteins, the periplasmic binding proteins, and the actins. This method is able to detect the structural similarity of the actins and 70- kilodalton heat shock proteins, even though these protein families share no detectable sequence similarity.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: The iDBPs server uses the three-dimensional (3D) structure of a query protein to predict whether it binds DNA. First, the algorithm predicts the functional region of the protein based on its evolutionary profile; the assumption is that large clusters of conserved residues are good markers of functional regions. Next, various characteristics of the predicted functional region as well as global features of the protein are calculated, such as the average surface electrostatic potential, the dipole moment and cluster-based amino acid conservation patterns. Finally, a random forests classifier is used to predict whether the query protein is likely to bind DNA and to estimate the prediction confidence. We have trained and tested the classifier on various datasets and shown that it outperformed related methods. On a dataset that reflects the fraction of DNA binding proteins (DBPs) in a proteome, the area under the ROC curve was 0.90. The application of the server to an updated version of the N-Func database, which contains proteins of unknown function with solved 3D-structure, suggested new putative DBPs for experimental studies.

In the absence of an experimentally determined structure, comparative or homology modeling can sometimes provide a useful 3-D model for a protein that is related to at least one known protein structure. Comparative modeling predicts the 3-D structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. This unit describes how to calculate comparative models using the program MODELLER and discusses all four steps of comparative modeling, frequently observed errors, and some applications.

abstract = {Replication protein A (RPA) is the ubiquitous, eukaryotic single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein and is essential for DNA replication, recombination, and repair. Here, crystal structures of the soluble RPA heterodimer, composed of the RPA14 and RPA32 subunits, have been determined for the full-length protein in multiple crystal forms. In all crystals, the electron density for the N-terminal (residues 1-42) and C-terminal (residues 175-270) regions of RPA32 is weak and of poor quality indicating that these regions are disordered and/or assume multiple positions in the crystals. Hence, the RPA32 N terminus, that is hyperphosphorylated in a cell-cycle-dependent manner and in response to DNA damaging agents, appears to be inherently disordered in the unphosphorylated state. The C-terminal, winged helix-loop-helix, protein-protein interaction domain adopts several conformations perhaps to facilitate its interaction with various proteins. Although the ordered regions of RPA14/32 resemble the previously solved protease-resistant core crystal structure, the quaternary structures between the heterodimers are quite different. Thus, the four-helix bundle quaternary assembly noted in the original core structure is unlikely to be related to the quaternary structure of the intact heterotrimer. An organic ligand binding site between subunits RPA14 and RPA32 was identified to bind dioxane. Comparison of the ssDNA binding surfaces of RPA70 with RPA14/32 showed that the lower affinity of RPA14/32 can be attributed to a shallower binding crevice with reduced positive electrostatic charge. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Within only a few minutes it returns the search results in a user-friendly format similar to that of PSI-BLAST. Search options include local or global alignment and scoring secondary structure similarity. HHpred can produce pairwise query-template alignments, multiple alignments of the query with a set of templates selected from the search results, as well as 3D structural models that are calculated by the MODELLER software from these alignments. A detailed help facility is available. As a demonstration, we analyze the sequence of SpoVT, a transcriptional regulator from Bacillus subtilis. HHpred can be accessed at http://protevo.eb.tuebingen.mpg.de/hhpred.},

abstract = {The DNA uptake competence (Com) system of the intracellular bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is considered nonfunctional. There are no known conditions for DNA transformation, and the Com master activator gene, comK, is interrupted by a temperate prophage. Here, we show that the L. monocytogenes Com system is required during infection to promote bacterial escape from macrophage phagosomes in a manner that is independent of DNA uptake. Further, we find that regulation of the Com system relies on the formation of a functional comK gene via prophage excision. Prophage excision is specifically induced during intracellular growth, primarily within phagosomes, yet, in contrast to classic prophage induction, progeny virions are not produced. This study presents the characterization of an active prophage that serves as a genetic switch to modulate the virulence of its bacterial host in the course of infection. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The nucleotide sequence of a 4243-bp PstI fragment containing the rec-2 gene of Haemophilus influenzae was determined. The amino acid (aa) sequences of four putative proteins were deduced from the corresponding open reading frames (ORFs). The 2400-bp ORF2 accounted for rec-2, based on the sequences of DNA fragments that contained rec-2::mini-Tn10 mutations. The rec-2 gene encoded a putative 800-aa protein with a Mr of 90561. Sequence analysis suggested that the rec-2 product contained nine highly probable integral membrane-spanning segments. Database searches showed that rec-2 was homologous to the comE-ORF3 gene of Bacillus subtilis. This hypothesis is consistent with the known involvement of both of these genes in the passage of transforming DNA through the competent-cell envelope. Although the sequences of the other three ORFs were incomplete, sufficient data were available to allow inferences about their homologies to other genes. ORF4, which overlapped ORF1, was homologous to the Escherichia coli dnaK suppresser gene, dksA, and therefore was named dsh-1 (dnaK suppresser homolog). Mutations in dsh-1 and its putative promoter region caused a mild sensitivity to UV light, but did not affect DNA recombination. ORF3, located downstream from rec-2, was homologous to msbA, an essential gene of E. coli with extensive similarity to the ATP-dependent translocators. ORF3 was named msh-1 (msbA homolog). Mutations in msh-1 had no effects on genetic transformation. The close juxtaposition of rec-2 and msh-1 implied that the expression of msh-1 could be linked to the translation of the rec-2 ORF. ?? 1994.},

@article{Mell2014,
abstract = {Many bacteria are naturally competent, able to actively transport environmental DNA fragments across their cell envelope and into their cytoplasm. Because incoming DNA fragments can recombine with and replace homologous segments of the chromosome, competence provides cells with a potent mechanism of horizontal gene transfer as well as access to the nutrients in extracellular DNA. This review starts with an introductory overview of competence and continues with a detailed consideration of the DNA uptake specificity of competent proteobacteria in the Pasteurellaceae and Neisseriaceae. Species in these distantly related families exhibit strong preferences for genomic DNA from close relatives, a self-specificity arising from the combined effects of biases in the uptake machinery and genomic overrepresentation of the sequences this machinery prefers. Other competent species tested lack obvious uptake bias or uptake sequences, suggesting that strong convergent evolutionary forces have acted on these two families. Recent results show that uptake sequences have multiple "dialects," with clades within each family preferring distinct sequence variants and having corresponding variants enriched in their genomes. Although the genomic consensus uptake sequences are 12 and 29 to 34 bp, uptake assays have found that only central cores of 3 to 4 bp, conserved across dialects, are crucial for uptake. The other bases, which differ between dialects, make weaker individual contributions but have important cooperative interactions. Together, these results make predictions about the mechanism of DNA uptake across the outer membrane, supporting a model for the evolutionary accumulation and stability of uptake sequences and suggesting that uptake biases may be more widespread than currently thought.},

abstract = {Natural transformation permits the transport of DNA through bacterial membranes and represents a dominant mode for the transfer of genetic information between bacteria and between microorganisms of distant evolutionary lineages and even between members of different domains. This phenomenon, known as horizontal, or lateral, gene transfer, has been a major force for genome plasticity over evolutionary history, and is largely responsible for the spread of fitness-enhancing traits, including antibiotic resistance and virulence factors. In particular, for adaptation of prokaryotes to extreme environments, lateral gene transfer seems to have played a crucial role. Here, we present a survey of the natural transformation machinery of the thermophile Thermus thermophilus HB27. A tentative model of the transformation machinery comprising of components similar to proteins of type IV pili and type II secretion systems is presented. A comparative discussion of the subunits and the structure of the DNA translocator and the underlying mechanism of transfer of free DNA in T. thermophilus highlights conserved and unique features of the DNA translocator in T. thermophilus. We hypothesize that the extraordinary broad substrate specificity and the high efficiency of the T. thermophilus DNA uptake system is of major importance for thermoadaptation and interdomain DNA transfer in hot environments.},

abstract = {We have re-examined the roles of nucA and nin, in the transformation of Bacillus subtilis as conflicting accounts have been presented concerning the importance of these genes for transformation. The present report demonstrates that nucA deficiency lowers the rate of DNA transport and that NucA is needed for the double-strand cleavage of transforming DNA, probably acting directly as an endonuclease. A relative paucity of DNA termini, resulting from the absence of this endonuclease activity, most probably accounts for the decreased transport rate. NucA is a bitopic integral membrane protein, with its C-terminus external to the membrane where it is appropriately located to effect the cleavage of bound transforming DNA. We have also investigated the roles of the known competence genes in the DNA processing that accompanies transformation in B. subtilis. The genes that are required for DNA transport (comEA, comEC and comFA) are also required for the degradation of the non-transforming strand that accompanies internalization, but comEC and comFA are not needed for the double-strand cleavage that occurs external to the cell membrane.},

abstract = {By a number of measures, alanine is poised at the threshold between those amino acids that promote the membrane integration of transmembrane alpha-helices and those that do not. We have measured the preference of alanine to partition into the lipid-water interface region over the central acyl chain region of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane both by its ability to promote the formation of so-called helical hairpins, i.e. a pair of transmembrane helices separated by a tight turn, and by mapping the position relative to the membrane of the lumenal end of a transmembrane alpha-helix that ends with a block of 10 alanines. Both measures show that Ala has a weak but distinct preference for the interface region, which is in agreement with recent biophysical measurements on pentaeptide partitioning in simple water-lipid or water-octanol systems (Jayasinghe, S., Hristova, K., and White, S. H. (2001) J. Mol. Biol. 312, 927-934). Considering the complexity of the translocon-mediated insertion of membrane proteins into the ER, the agreement between the biochemical and biophysical measurements is striking and suggests that protein-lipid interactions are already important during the very early steps of membrane protein assembly in the ER.},

Here, through an analysis of bacteriorhodopsin crystal structures and the transmembrane helix structure from M2 protein of influenza A, some helices are shown to be exceptionally uniform in hydrogen bond geometry, peptide plane tilt angle, and backbone torsion angles. Evidence from both the x-ray crystal structures and solid-state NMR structure suggests that the intramolecular backbone hydrogen bonds are shorter than their counterparts in water-soluble proteins. Moreover, the geometry is consistent with a dominance of electrostatic versus covalent contributions to these bonds. A comparison of structure as a function of resolution shows that as the structures become better characterized the helices become much more uniform, suggesting that there is a possibility that many more uniform helices will be observed, even among the moderate resolution membrane protein structures that are currently in the Protein Data Bank that do not show such features.},

Analysis of the SSRs on 16 barley cultivars revealed variable levels of informativeness but no obvious correlation was found with SSR repeat length, motif type, or map position. Of the 568 SSRs developed, 242 were genetically mapped, 216 with 37 previously published SSRs in a single doubled-haploid population derived from the F(1) of an interspecific cross between the cultivar Lina and Hordeum spontaneum Canada Park and 26 SSRs in two other mapping populations. A total of 27 SSRs amplified multiple loci. Centromeric clustering of markers was observed in the main mapping population; however, the clustering severity was reduced in intraspecific crosses, supporting the notion that the observed marker distribution was largely a genetical effect. The mapped SSRs provide a framework for rapidly assigning chromosomal designations and polarity in future mapping programs in barley and a convenient alternative to RFLP for aligning information derived from different populations. A list of the 242 primer pairs that amplify mapped SSRs from total barley genomic DNA is presented.},

abstract = {The recognition of transmembrane helices by the translocon is primarily guided by the average hydrophobicity of the potential transmembrane helix. However, the exact hydrophobicity of each amino acid can be identified in several different ways. The free energy of transfer for amino acid analogues between a hydrophobic media, for example, octanol and water can be measured or obtained from simulations, the hydrophobicity can also be estimated by statistical properties from known transmembrane segments and finally the contribution of each amino acid type for the probability of translocon recognition has recently been measured directly. Although these scales correlate quite well, there are clear differences between them and it is not well understood which scale represents neither the biology best nor what the differences are. Here, we try to provide some answers to this by studying the ability of different scales to recognize transmembrane helices and predict the topology of transmembrane proteins. From this analysis it is clear that the biological hydrophobicity scale as well scales created from statistical analysis of membrane helices perform better than earlier experimental scales that are mainly based on measurements of amino acid analogs and not directly on transmembrane helix recognition. Using these results we identified the properties of the scales that perform better than other scales. We find, for instance, that the better performing scales consider proline more hydrophilic. This shows that transmembrane recognition is not only governed by pure hydrophobicity but also by the helix preferences for amino acids, as proline is a strong helix breaker.

abstract = {Prostaglandins (PG) are bioactive lipids produced from arachidonic acid via the action of cyclooxygenases and terminal PG synthases. Microsomal prostaglandin E synthase 1 (MPGES1) constitutes an inducible glutathione-dependent integral membrane protein that catalyzes the oxidoreduction of cyclooxygenase derived PGH(2) into PGE(2). MPGES1 has been implicated in a number of human diseases or pathological conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, fever, and pain, and is therefore regarded as a primary target for development of novel antiinflammatory drugs. To provide a structural basis for insight in the catalytic mechanism, we determined the structure of MPGES1 in complex with glutathione by electron crystallography from 2D crystals induced in the presence of phospholipids. Together with results from site-directed mutagenesis and activity measurements, we can thereby demonstrate the role of specific amino acid residues. Glutathione is found to bind in a U-shaped conformation at the interface between subunits in the protein trimer. It is exposed to a site facing the lipid bilayer, which forms the specific environment for the oxidoreduction of PGH(2) to PGE(2) after displacement of the cytoplasmic half of the N-terminal transmembrane helix. Hence, insight into the dynamic behavior of MPGES1 and homologous membrane proteins in inflammation and detoxification is provided.},

Tail-anchored (TA) membrane proteins, characterized by a single C-terminal TM, pose an additional level of complexity because they must be post-translationally targeted. In eukaryotes, the GET pathway shuttles TA-proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum. The key proteins required in yeast (Sgt2 and Get1-5) have been under extensive structural and biochemical investigation during recent years. The central protein Get3 utilizes nucleotide linked conformational changes to facilitate substrate loading and targeting.

An increasing fraction of new sequences are identical to a sequence that already exists in the database with the majority of sequences coming from genome sequencing projects. We have created a new proteome identifier that uniquely identifies a particular assembly of a species and strain or subspecies to help users track the provenance of sequences. We present a new website that has been designed using a user-experience design process. We have introduced an annotation score for all entries in UniProt to represent the relative amount of knowledge known about each protein.

@article{Lan2000,
abstract = {A distinct class of proteins contain a C-terminal membrane anchor and a cytoplasmic functional domain. A subset of these proteins is targeted to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Here, to probe for the involvement of a saturable targeting mechanism for this class of proteins, and to elucidate the roles of chaperone proteins and ATP, we have utilized an in vitro targeting system consisting of in vitro-synthesized proteins and isolated mitochondria. To establish the specificity of targeting we have used a closely related protein pair. VAMP-1A and VAMP-1B are splice variants of the vesicle-associated membrane protein/synaptobrevin-1 (VAMP-1) gene. In intact cells VAMP-1B is targeted to mitochondria whereas VAMP-1A is targeted to membranes of the secretory pathway, yet these isoforms differ by only five amino acids at the extreme C-terminus. Here we demonstrate that, in vitro, VAMP-1B is imported into both intact mitochondria and mitochondrial outer-membrane vesicles with a 15-fold greater efficiency than VAMP-1A. We generated and purified bacterially expressed fusion proteins consisting of the C-terminal two-thirds of VAMP-1A or -1B proteins fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST). Using these fusion proteins we demonstrate that protein targeting and insertion is saturable and specific for the VAMP-1B membrane anchor. To elucidate the role of cytosolic chaperones on VAMP-1B targeting, we also used the purified, Escherichia coli-derived fusion proteins. (33)P-Labelled GST-VAMP-1B(61-116), but not GST-VAMP-1A(61-118), was efficiently targeted to mitochondria in a chaperone-free system. Thus the information required for targeting is contained within the targeted protein itself and not the chaperone or a chaperone-protein complex, although chaperones may be required to maintain a transport-competent conformation. Moreover, ATP was required for transport only in the presence of cytosolic chaperone proteins. Therefore the ATP requirement of transport appears to reflect the participation of chaperones and not any other ATP-dependent step. These data demonstrate that targeting of C-terminally anchored proteins to mitochondria is sequence specific and mediated by a saturable mechanism. Neither ATP nor chaperone proteins are strictly required for either specific targeting or membrane insertion.},

abstract = {Tail-anchored (TA) proteins are membrane proteins that contain an N-terminal domain exposed to the cytosol and a single transmembrane segment near the C-terminus followed by few or no polar residues. TA proteins with a mildly hydrophobic transmembrane domain, such as cytochrome b5 (b5), are able to insert post-translationally into pure lipid vesicles without assistance from membrane proteins. Here, we investigated whether any cytosolic proteins are needed to maintain b5 in a competent state for transmembrane integration. Using b5 constructs translated in vitro or produced in bacteria, we demonstrate that cytosolic proteins are neither necessary nor facilitatory for the unassisted translocation of b5. Furthermore, we demonstrate that no cytosolic protein is involved in the translocation of a C-terminal domain of 85 residues appended to the transmembrane domain of b5. Nevertheless, b5 does bind cytosolic proteins, and in their presence but not in their absence, its insertion into liposomes is inhibited by the thiol oxidant diamide and the alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide. The effect of diamide is also observed in living cells. Thus, the specific in vivo targeting of b5 might be achieved by interaction with redox-sensitive targeting factors that hinder its nonspecific insertion into any permissive bilayer.},

abstract = {By analyzing transmembrane (TM) helices in known structures, we find that some polar amino acids are more frequent at the N terminus than at the C terminus. We propose the asymmetry occurs because most polar amino acids are better able to snorkel their polar atoms away from the membrane core at the N terminus than at the C terminus. Two findings lead us to this proposition: (1) side-chain conformations are influenced strongly by the N or C-terminal position of the amino acid in the bilayer, and (2) the favored snorkeling direction of an amino acid correlates well with its N to C-terminal composition bias. Our results suggest that TM helix predictions should incorporate an N to C-terminal composition bias, that rotamer preferences of TM side-chains are position-dependent, and that the ability to snorkel influences the evolutionary selection of amino acids for the helix N and C termini. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Transmembrane (TM) proteins comprise 20-30{\%} of the genome but, because of experimental difficulties, they represent less than 1{\%} of the Protein Data Bank. The dearth of membrane protein structures makes computational prediction a potentially important means of obtaining novel structures. Recent advances in computational methods have been combined with experimental data to constrain the modeling of three-dimensional structures. Furthermore, threading and ab initio modeling approaches that were effective for soluble proteins have been applied to TM domains. Surprisingly, experimental structures, proteomic analyses and bioinformatics have revealed unexpected architectures that counter long-held views on TM protein structure and stability. Future computational and experimental studies aimed at understanding the thermodynamic and evolutionary bases of these architectural details will greatly enhance predictive capabilities. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {To find motifs that mediate helix-helix interactions in membrane proteins, we have analyzed frequently occurring combinations of residues in a database of transmembrane domains. Our analysis was performed with a novel formalism, which we call TMSTAT, for exactly calculating the expectancies of all pairs and triplets of residues in individual sequences, taking into account differential sequence composition and the substantial effect of finite length in short segments. We found that the number of significantly over and under-represented pairs and triplets was much greater than the random expectation. Isoleucine, glycine and valine were the most common residues in these extreme cases. The main theme observed is patterns of small residues (Gly, Ala and Ser) at i and i+4 found in association with large aliphatic residues (Ile, Val and Leu) at neighboring positions (i.e. i+/-1 and i+/-2). The most over-represented pair is formed by two glycine residues at i and i+4 (GxxxG, 31.6 {\%} above expectation, p{\textless}1x10(-33)) and it is strongly associated with the neighboring beta-branched residues Ile and Val. In fact, the GxxxG pair has been described as part of the strong interaction motif in the glycophorin A transmembrane dimer, in which the pair is associated with two Val residues (GVxxGV). GxxxG is also the major motif identified using TOXCAT, an in vivo selection system for transmembrane oligomerization motifs. In conjunction with these experimental observations, our results highlight the importance of the GxxxG+beta-branched motif in transmembrane helix-helix interactions. In addition, the special role for the beta-branched residues Ile and Val suggested here is consistent with the hypothesis that residues with constrained rotameric freedom in helical conformation might reduce the entropic cost of folding in transmembrane proteins.

abstract = {We have observed a common sequence motif in membrane proteins, which we call a glycine zipper. Glycine zipper motifs are strongly overrepresented and conserved in membrane protein sequences, and mutations in glycine zipper motifs are deleterious to function in many cases. The glycine zipper has a significant structural impact, engendering a strong driving force for right-handed packing against a neighboring helix. Thus, the presence of a glycine zipper motif leads directly to testable structural hypotheses, particularly for a subclass of glycine zipper proteins that form channels. For example, we suggest that the membrane pores formed by the amyloid-beta peptide in vitro are constructed by glycine zipper packing and find that mutations in the glycine zipper motif block channel formation. Our findings highlight an important structural motif in a wide variety of normal and pathological processes.},

Prior to fusion, transport vesicles are physically linked to their target membranes by various tethering factors. Recent studies suggest that tethering factors also positively regulate the assembly of functional SNARE complexes, thereby coupling tethering with fusion events. This coupling is mediated, at least in part, by direct physical interactions between tethering factors, SNAREs, and Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins.

abstract = {The abundance of cell-surface membrane proteins isregulated by internalization and delivery into intralumenal vesicles (ILVs) of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Many cargoes are ubiquitinated, allowing access to an ESCRT-dependent pathway into MVBs. Yet how nonubiquitinated proteins, such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, enter MVBs is unclear, supporting the possibility of mechanistically distinct ILV biogenesis pathways. Here we show that a family of highly ubiquitinated tetraspan Cos proteins provides a Ub signal in trans, allowing sorting of nonubiquitinated MVB cargo into the canonical ESCRT- and Ub-dependent pathway. Cos proteins create discrete endosomal subdomains that concentrate Ub cargo prior to their envelopment into ILVs, and the activity of Cos proteins is required not only for efficient sorting of canonical Ub cargo but also for sorting nonubiquitinated cargo into MVBs. Expression of these proteins increases during nutrient stress through an NAD{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}/Sir2-dependent mechanism that in turn accelerates the downregulation of a broad range of cell-surface proteins.},

The latter includes membranes that envelope the nucleus, the outer and inner membranes of the mitochondria, membrane cisternae complex of the ER, Golgi apparatus, as well as lysosomes and secretory vesicles. Depending on their localizations in the whole organism and also within the cell, these membranes have different, highly specialized functions.

Given the importance of membrane proteins in the various cellular processes listed in this review, as well as the roles they play in diseases and their potential as drug targets, it is imperative that this class of proteins be better studied. With the recent advancement in technology, it is expected that some of the difficulties in membrane proteomics will be overcome, yielding new data on membrane proteins.},

The water and lipid environments were taken into account via an effective medium approximation based on coordinate-dependent hydrophobic and hydrogen bond potentials. The polypeptide chain was represented in a full-backbone atom representation as a chain of diamond lattice vectors. The simulations support the idea that to a good approximation insertion may be depicted as a spontaneous thermodynamic process. The mechanism of membrane insertion of a simple lattice protein chain exhibits many features of theoretical predictions and is in good accord with experimental data. In the model, insertion begins with adsorption of the chain onto the interface, followed by the formation of helical fragments. These fragments, having partially saturated internal hydrogen bonds, can be transported into the lipid phase and then form transbilayer structures.},

@article{White2007,
abstract = {Membrane proteins are a greasy lot. Thrown into water without detergents, they form intractable aggregates, which minimize exposure of their nonpolar transmem- brane surfaces to water. Aggregation would be their cer- tain fate if membrane proteins were translated on the ribosome in the manner of soluble proteins. But this fate is avoided: the elongating polypeptide segment from the ribosome exit tunnel (Voss et al., 2006) passes into the membrane-dwelling translocon assembly whose architecture permits selected segments to enter the membrane bilayer to become transmembrane (TM) he- lices (for review see White and von Heijne, 2004, 2005; von Heijne, 2006). The principles underlying this selec- tion process are beginning to emerge from our recent studies of the recognition of transmembrane helices by the ER translocon (Hessa et al., 2005a; Meindl-Beinker et al., 2006). As Gunnar von Heijne discusses in his Per- spective (p. 353), one outcome of our experiments was a ‚Äúbiological‚Äù hydrophobicity scale that describes the apparent free energy of insertion (‚àÜGapp) of each of the 20 natural amino acids when located in the center of a hydrophobic TM helix. This biological scale correlated strongly with the so-called Wimley-White (1999) physical hydrophobicity scales, suggesting that, somehow, the translocon selection of TM segments fol- lows general thermodynamic principles that underlie partitioning of peptides between water and n-octanol (Wimley et al., 1996). The primary goal of this Perspec- tive is to explore this intriguing nexus between biology and physical chemistry. One of the motivations for this series of Perspectives is to gain deeper insights into the connection between the biological hydrophobicity scale and physical scales, especially the Wimley-White (1999) octanol scale. Our current understanding of membranes, hydrophobicity, and membrane protein stability originates from the Fluid Mosaic Membrane Model (Singer and Nicolson, 1972). I therefore begin by reviewing the origins of this conceptual model, which is built upon the fundamental idea that hydrophobic molecules (e.g., membrane pro- teins) partition between water and immiscible nonpolar phases (e.g., lipid bilayers). Because this concept arose before our understanding of the structure and dynamics of fluid bilayers was complete, I next discuss the mod- ern view of lipid bilayer structure and dynamics, which is essential for connecting the biological and physical scales. Implicit in the motivation for this Perspectives series is the apparent ability of the translocon to insert charge-containing TM helices across the ER membrane. I discuss how this might work in the light of the modern view of bilayer structure. This sets the stage for consid- ering why the biological hydrophobicity scale correlates so strongly with the Wimley-White octanol scale. I at- tempt to provide an explanation. To begin to connect the biological and physical hydrophobicity scales, I then discuss insights into translocon function obtained from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of SecY/Sec61 heterotrimer in lipid bilayers. I argue that the heterotri- mer is ideally suited to serve as a thermodynamic switch that determines whether or not a polypeptide segment passes into the lipid bilayer as a TM segment. Finally, I consider whether TM helix recognition by the translo- con is equivalent to direct partitioning of helices be- tween water and lipid bilayer.},

abstract = {We propose that the initial event in the secretion of proteins across membranes and their insertion into membranes is the spontaneous penetration of the hydrophobic portion of the bilayer by a helical hairpin. Energetic considerations of polypeptide structures in a nonpolar, lipid environment compared with an aqueous environment suggest that only ?? and 310 helices will be observed in the hydrophobic interior of membranes. Insertion of a polypeptide is accomplished by a hairpin structure composed of two helices, which will partition into membranes if the free energy arising from burying hydrophobic helical surfaces exceeds the free energy "cost" of burying potentially charged and hydrogen-bonding groups. We suggest, for example, that the hydrophobic leader peptide found in secreted proteins and in many membrane proteins forms one of these helices and is oriented in the membrane with its N terminus inside. In secreted proteins, the leader functions by pulling polar portions of a protein into the membrane as the second helix of the hairpin. The occurrence of all categories of membrane proteins can be rationalized by the hydrophobic or hydrophilic character of the two helices of the inserted hairpin and, for some integral membrane proteins, by events in which a single terminal helix is inserted. We propose that, because of the distribution of polar and nonpolar sequences in the polypeptide sequence, secretion and the insertion of membrane proteins are spontaneous processes that do not require the participation of additional specific membrane receptors or transport proteins. ?? 1981.},

abstract = {$\alpha$-Helical hairpins, consisting of a pair of closely spaced transmembrane (TM) helices that are connected by a short interfacial turn, are the simplest structural motifs found in multi-spanning membrane proteins. In naturally occurring hairpins, the presence of polar residues is common and predicted to complicate membrane insertion. We postulate that the pre-packing process offsets any energetic cost of allocating polar and charged residues within the hydrophobic environment of biological membranes. Consistent with this idea, we provide here experimental evidence demonstrating that helical hairpin insertion into biological membranes can be driven by electrostatic interactions between closely separated, poorly hydrophobic sequences. Additionally, we observe that the integral hairpin can be stabilized by a short loop heavily populated by turn-promoting residues. We conclude that the combined effect of TM-TM electrostatic interactions and tight turns plays an important role in generating the functional architecture of membrane proteins and propose that helical hairpin motifs can be acquired within the context of the Sec61 translocon at the early stages of membrane protein biosynthesis. Taken together, these data further underline the potential complexities involved in accurately predicting TM domains from primary structures. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The molecular surface buried inside the protein is 58{\%} non-polar, 39{\%} polar and 4{\%} charged. The buried surface contains more uncharged polar groups (mostly peptides) than the surface that remains accessible, but many fewer charged groups. On average, 15{\%} of residues in small proteins and 32{\%} in larger ones may be classed as "buried residues", having less than 5{\%} of their surface accessible to the solvent. The accessibilities of most other residues are evenly distributed in the range 5 to 50{\%}. Although the fraction of buried residues increases with molecular weight, the amino acid compositions of the protein interior and surface show no systematic variation with molecular weight, except for small proteins that are often very rich in buried cysteines. From amino acid compositions of protein surfaces and interiors we calculate an effective coefficient of partition for each type of residue, and derive an implied set of transfer free energy values. This is compared with other sets of partition coefficients derived directly from experimental data. The extent to which groups of residues (charged, polar and non-polar) are buried within proteins correlates well with their hydrophobicity derived from amino acid transfer experiments. Within these three groups, the correlation is low. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

Walter. 1991. Cell. 67:131-144). We have established that the two targeting pathways function in parallel. Mutant alleles of SEC62 and SEC63 were isolated that specifically impaired the translocation of SRP-independent preproteins in vivo and in vitro, whereas SRP-dependent preproteins were unaffected. Based on this analysis, preproteins fall into three distinct classes: SRP dependent, SRP independent, and those that can use both pathways. Pathway specificity is conferred by the hydrophobic core of signal sequences. Our studies show a previously unrecognized diversity in ER-directed signal sequences, that carry structural information that serves to identify the route taken.},

abstract = {Proteins destined for the endomembrane system of eukaryotic cells are typically translocated into or across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and this process is normally closely coupled to protein synthesis. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that a significant proportion of proteins are targeted to and inserted into the ER membrane post-translationally, that is after their synthesis is complete. These proteins must be efficiently captured and delivered to the target membrane, and indeed a failure to do so may even disrupt proteostasis resulting in cellular dysfunction and disease. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms by which various protein precursors can be targeted to the ER and either inserted into or translocated across the membrane post-translationally.

abstract = {Small multidrug resistance (SMR) transport proteins provide a model for the evolution of larger two-domain transport proteins. The orientation in the membrane of 27 proteins from the SMR family was determined using the reporter fusion technique. Nine members were encoded monocistronically (singles) and shown to insert in both orientations (dual topology). Eighteen members were encoded in pairs on the chromosome and shown to insert in fixed orientations; the two proteins in each pair invariably had opposite orientations in the membrane. Interaction between the two proteins in pairs was demonstrated by copurification. The orientation in the membrane of either protein in the pair was affected only marginally by the presence of the other protein.For the proteins in pairs, the orientation in the membrane correlated well with the distribution of positively charges residues (R. +. K) over the cytoplasmic and extracellular loops (positive-inside rule). In contrast, dual-topology insertion of the singles was predicted less well by the positive-inside rule. Three singles were predicted to insert in a single orientation with the N-terminus and the C-terminus at the extracellular side of the membrane. Analysis of charge distributions suggests the requirement of a threshold number of charges in the cytoplasmic loops for the positive-inside rule to be of predictive value. It is concluded that a combined analysis of gene organization on the chromosome and phylogeny is sufficient to distinguish between fixed or dual topology of SMR members and, probably, similar types of membrane proteins. The positive-inside rule can be used to predict the orientation of members in pairs, but is not suitable as a sole predictor of dual topology. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The translocon recognizes transmembrane helices with sufficient level of hydrophobicity and inserts them into the membrane. However, sometimes less hydrophobic helices are also recognized. Positive inside rule, orientational preferences of and specific interactions with neighboring helices have been shown to aid in the recognition of these helices, at least in artificial systems. To better understand how the translocon inserts marginally hydrophobic helices, we studied three naturally occurring marginally hydrophobic helices, which were previously shown to require the subsequent helix for efficient translocon recognition. We find no evidence for specific interactions when we scan all residues in the subsequent helices. Instead, we identify arginines located at the N-terminal part of the subsequent helices that are crucial for the recognition of the marginally hydrophobic transmembrane helices, indicating that the positive inside rule is important. However, in two of the constructs, these arginines do not aid in the recognition without the rest of the subsequent helix; that is, the positive inside rule alone is not sufficient. Instead, the improved recognition of marginally hydrophobic helices can here be explained as follows: the positive inside rule provides an orientational preference of the subsequent helix, which in turn allows the marginally hydrophobic helix to be inserted; that is, the effect of the positive inside rule is stronger if positively charged residues are followed by a transmembrane helix. Such a mechanism obviously cannot aid C-terminal helices, and consequently, we find that the terminal helices in multi-spanning membrane proteins are more hydrophobic than internal helices. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The BAG6 protein is a subunit of a heterotrimeric complex that binds a range of membrane and secretory protein precursors localized to the cytosol, enforcing quality control and influencing their subsequent fate.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: BAG6 has an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain, and a C-terminal Bcl-2-associated athanogene domain, separated by a large central proline-rich region. We have used in vitro binding approaches to identify regions of BAG6 important for its interactions with: i) the small-glutamine rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein alpha (SGTA) and ii) two model tail-anchored membrane proteins as a paradigm for its hydrophobic substrates. We show that the BAG6-UBL is essential for binding to SGTA, and find that the UBL of a second subunit of the BAG6-complex, ubiquitin-like protein 4A (UBL4A), competes for SGTA binding. Our data show that this binding is selective, and suggest that SGTA can bind either BAG6, or UBL4A, but not both at the same time. We adapted our in vitro binding assay to study the association of BAG6 with an immobilized tail-anchored protein, Sec61$\beta$, and find both the UBL and BAG domains are dispensable for binding this substrate. This conclusion was further supported using a heterologous subcellular localization assay in yeast, where the BAG6-dependent nuclear relocalization of a second tail-anchored protein, GFP-Sed5, also required neither the UBL, nor the BAG domain of BAG6.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSIGNIFICANCE: On the basis of these findings, we propose a working model where the large central region of the BAG6 protein provides a binding site for a diverse group of substrates, many of which expose a hydrophobic stretch of polypeptide. This arrangement would enable the BAG6 complex to bring together its substrates with potential effectors including those recruited via its N-terminal UBL. Such effectors may include SGTA, and the resulting assemblies influence the subsequent fate of the hydrophobic BAG6 substrates.},

abstract = {Tail-anchored (TA) proteins function in key cellular processes in eukaryotic cells, such as vesicle trafficking, protein translocation and regulation of transcription. They anchor to internal cell membranes by a C-terminal transmembrane domain, which also serves as a targeting sequence. Targeting occurs post-translationally, via pathways that are specific to the precursor, which makes TA proteins a model system for investigating post-translational protein targeting. Bioinformatics approaches have previously been used to identify potential TA proteins in yeast and humans, yet little is known about TA proteins in plants. The identification of plant TA proteins is important for extending the post-translational model system to plastids, in addition to general proteome characterization, and the identification of functional homologues characterized in other organisms. We identified 454 loci that potentially encode TA proteins in Arabidopsis, and combined published data with new localization experiments to assign localizations to 130 proteins, including 29 associated with plastids. By analysing the tail anchor sequences of characterized proteins, we have developed a tool for predicting localization and estimate that 138 TA proteins are localized to plastids.},

Here, we directly determine the partitioning free energies of a family of designed peptides using three independent approaches: an experimental microsomal Sec61 translocon assay, a biophysical (spectroscopic) characterization of peptide insertion into hydrated planar lipid bilayer arrays, and an unbiased atomic-detail equilibrium folding-partitioning molecular dynamics simulation. Remarkably, the measured free energies of insertion are quantitatively similar for all three approaches. The molecular dynamics simulations show that TM helix insertion involves equilibrium with the membrane interface, suggesting that the interface may play a role in translocon-guided insertion.},

abstract = {Membrane-embedded voltage-sensor domains in voltage-dependent potassium channels (K(v) channels) contain an impressive number of charged residues. How can such highly charged protein domains be efficiently inserted into biological membranes? In the plant K(v) channel KAT1, the S2, S3, and S4 transmembrane helices insert cooperatively, because the S3, S4, and S3-S4 segments do not have any membrane insertion ability by themselves. Here we show that, in the Drosophila Shaker K(v) channel, which has a more hydrophobic S3 helix than KAT1, S3 can both insert into the membrane by itself and mediate the insertion of the S3-S4 segment in the absence of S2. An engineered KAT1 S3-S4 segment in which the hydrophobicity of S3 was increased or where S3 was replaced by Shaker S3 behaves as Shaker S3-S4. Electrostatic interactions among charged residues in S2, S3, and S4, including the salt bridges between E283 or E293 in S2 and R368 in S4, are required for fully efficient membrane insertion of the Shaker voltage-sensor domain. These results suggest that cooperative insertion of the voltage-sensor transmembrane helices is a property common to K(v) channels and that the degree of cooperativity depends on a balance between electrostatic and hydrophobic forces.},

Thus, AQP4 integration by Sec61alpha involves sequential triage of TMs from their initial portal of entry into multiple secondary sites within the translocon. This mechanism provides a means to facilitate early folding events before release into the lipid bilayer.},

abstract = {The Sec61 translocon mediates the translocation of proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and the lateral integration of transmembrane segments into the lipid bilayer. The structure of the idle translocon is closed by a lumenal plug domain and a hydrophobic constriction ring. To test the function of the apolar constriction, we have mutated all six ring residues of yeast Sec61p to more hydrophilic, bulky, or even charged amino acids (alanines, glycines, serines, tryptophans, lysines, or aspartates). The translocon was found to be surprisingly tolerant even to the charge mutations in the constriction ring, because growth and translocation efficiency were not drastically affected. Most interestingly, ring mutants were found to affect the integration of hydrophobic sequences into the lipid bilayer, indicating that the translocon does not simply catalyze the partitioning of potential transmembrane segments between an aqueous environment and the lipid bilayer but that it also plays an active role in setting the hydrophobicity threshold for membrane integration.},

abstract = {The Sec61 translocon forms a pore to translocate polypeptide sequences across the membrane and offers a lateral gate for membrane integration of hydrophobic (H) segments. A central constriction of six apolar residues has been shown to form a seal, but also to determine the hydrophobicity threshold for membrane integration: Mutation of these residues in yeast Sec61p to glycines, serines, aspartates, or lysines lowered the hydrophobicity required for integration; mutation to alanines increased it. Whereas four leucines distributed in an oligo-alanine H segment were sufficient for 50{\%} integration, we now find four leucines in the N-terminal half of the H segment to produce significantly more integration than in the C-terminal half, suggesting functional asymmetry within the translocon. Scanning a cluster of three leucines through an oligo-alanine H segment showed high integration levels, except around the position matching that of the hydrophobic constriction in the pore where integration was strongly reduced. Both asymmetry and the position effect of H-segment integration disappeared upon mutation of the constriction residues to glycines or serines, demonstrating that hydrophobicity at this position within the translocon is responsible for the phenomenon. Asymmetry was largely retained, however, when constriction residues were replaced by alanines. These results reflect on the integration mechanism of transmembrane domains and show that membrane insertion of H segments strongly depends not only on their intrinsic hydrophobicity but also on the local conditions in the translocon interior. Thus, the contribution of hydrophobic residues in the H segment is not simply additive and displays cooperativeness depending on their relative position.},

abstract = {A conserved heterotrimeric membrane protein complex, the Sec61 or SecY complex, forms a protein-conducting channel, allowing polypeptides to be transferred across or integrated into membranes. We report the crystal structure of the complex from Methanococcus jannaschii at a resolution of 3.2 A. The structure suggests that one copy of the heterotrimer serves as a functional translocation channel. The alpha-subunit has two linked halves, transmembrane segments 1-5 and 6-10, clamped together by the gamma-subunit. A cytoplasmic funnel leading into the channel is plugged by a short helix. Plug displacement can open the channel into an 'hourglass' with a ring of hydrophobic residues at its constriction. This ring may form a seal around the translocating polypeptide, hindering the permeation of other molecules. The structure also suggests mechanisms for signal-sequence recognition and for the lateral exit of transmembrane segments of nascent membrane proteins into lipid, and indicates binding sites for partners that provide the driving force for translocation.},

Consequently, functional studies of these networks at a molecular level require co-reconstitution of the interacting components. Here, we report a SNARE protein-based method for incorporation of multiple membrane proteins into artificial membrane vesicles of well-defined composition, and for delivery of large water-soluble substrates into these vesicles. The approach is used for in vitro reconstruction of a fully functional bacterial respiratory chain from purified components. Furthermore, the method is used for functional incorporation of the entire F1F0 ATP synthase complex into native bacterial membranes from which this component had been genetically removed. The novel methodology offers a tool to investigate complex interaction networks between membrane-bound proteins at a molecular level, which is expected to generate functional insights into key cellular functions.},

abstract = {The biogenesis, folding, and structure of $\alpha$-helical membrane proteins (MPs) are important to understand because they underlie virtually all physiological processes in cells including key metabolic pathways, such as the respiratory chain and the photosystems, as well as the transport of solutes and signals across membranes. Nearly all MPs require translocons - often referred to as protein-conducting channels - for proper insertion into their target membrane. Remarkable progress toward understanding the structure and functioning of translocons has been made during the past decade. Here, we review and assess this progress critically. All available evidence indicates that MPs are equilibrium structures that achieve their final structural states by folding along thermodynamically controlled pathways. The main challenge for cells is the targeting and membrane insertion of highly hydrophobic amino acid sequences. Targeting and insertion are managed in cells principally by interactions between ribosomes and membrane-embedded translocons. Our review examines the biophysical and biological boundaries of MP insertion and the folding of polytopic MPs in vivo. A theme of the review is the under-appreciated role of basic thermodynamic principles in MP folding and assembly. Thermodynamics not only dictates the final folded structure but also is the driving force for the evolution of the ribosome-translocon system of assembly. We conclude the review with a perspective suggesting a new view of translocon-guided MP insertion.},

The case of the trans-membrane water-channel protein aquaporin GlpF from E. coli imbedded in lipid-bilayer membranes is discussed in some detail. Numerical data obtained from Molecular Dynamics simulations show on the one side that the lipid bilayer adapts to the channel by a hydrophobic matching condition which reflects the propensity of the lipid molecules for forming curved structures. On the other side, it is demonstrated that the transport function of the channel is modulated by the matching condition and/or the curvature stress in a lipid-specific manner. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Biological membranes are characterized by a heterogeneous composition, which is not only manifested in the wide variety of their components, but also in aspects like the lateral organization, topology, and conformation of proteins and lipids. In bringing about the correct membrane structure, protein-lipid interactions can be expected to play a prominent role. The extent of hydrophobic matching between transmembrane protein segments and lipids potentially constitutes a versatile director of membrane organization, because a tendency to avoid hydrophobic mismatch could result in compensating adaptations such as tilt of the transmembrane segment or segregation into distinct domains. Also, interfacial interactions between lipid headgroups and the aromatic and charged residues that typically flank transmembrane domains may act as an organizing element. In this review, we discuss the numerous model studies that have systematically explored the influence of hydrophobic matching and interfacial anchoring on membrane structure. Designed peptides consisting of a polyleucine or polyleucine/alanine hydrophobic stretch, which is flanked on both sides by tryptophan or lysine residues, reflect the general layout of transmembrane protein segments. It is shown for phosphatidylcholine bilayers and for other model membranes that these peptides adapt a transmembrane topology without extensive peptide or lipid adaptations under conditions of hydrophobic matching, but that significant rearrangements can result from hydrophobic mismatch. Moreover, these effects depend on the nature of the flanking residues, implying a modulation of the mismatch response by interfacial interactions of the flanking residues. The implications of these model studies for the organization of biomembranes are discussed in the context of recent experiments with more complex systems.},

A specialized pathway, called the guided entry of TA proteins (GET) pathway in yeast and the transmembrane domain recognition complex (TRC) pathway in vertebrates, recognizes endoplasmic-reticulum-targeted TA proteins and delivers them through a complex series of handoffs. An early step is the formation of a complex between Sgt2/SGTA, a cochaperone with a presumed ubiquitin-like-binding domain (UBD), and Get5/UBL4A, a ubiquitin-like domain (UBL)-containing protein. We structurally characterize this UBD/UBL interaction for both yeast and human proteins. This characterization is supported by biophysical studies that demonstrate that complex formation is mediated by electrostatics, generating an interface that has high-affinity with rapid kinetics. In total, this work provides a refined model of the interplay of Sgt2 homologs in TA targeting.},

While some features are routinely used, such as the avoidance of extensive non-polar surface area, scope remains for benchmarking of sequence and structural features with experimental data. We study properties in the context of experimental solubilities, protein gene expression levels, and families of abundant proteins (serum albumin and myoglobin) and their less abundant paralogues. A common feature that emerges for proteins with elevated solubility and at higher expression and abundance levels is an increased ratio of lysine content to arginine content. We suggest that the same properties of arginine that give rise to its recorded propensity for specific interaction surfaces also lead to favorable interactions at nonspecific contacts, and thus lysine is favored for proteins at relatively high concentration. A survey of protein therapeutics shows that a significant subset possesses a relatively low lysine to arginine ratio, and therefore may not be favored for high protein concentration. We conclude that modulation of lysine and arginine content could prove a useful and relatively simple addition to the toolkit available for engineering protein solubility in biotechnological applications.},

abstract = {Ischemia of the myocardium and lower limbs is a common consequence of arterial disease and a major source of morbidity and mortality in modernized countries. Inducing neovascularization for the treatment of ischemia is an appealing therapeutic strategy for patients for whom traditional treatment modalities cannot be performed or are ineffective. In the past, the stimulation of blood vessel growth was pursued using direct delivery of growth factors, angiogenic gene therapy, or cellular therapy. Although therapeutic angiogenesis holds great promise for treating patients with ischemia, current methods have not found success in clinical trials. Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) was one of the first growth factors to be tested for use in therapeutic angiogenesis. Here, we present a method for improving the biological activity of FGF-2 by codelivering the growth factor with a liposomally embedded coreceptor, syndecan-4. This technique was shown to increase FGF-2 cellular signaling, uptake, and nuclear localization in comparison with FGF-2 alone. Delivery of syndecan-4 proteoliposomes also increased endothelial proliferation, migration, and angiogenic tube formation in response to FGF-2. Using an animal model of limb ischemia, syndecan-4 proteoliposomes markedly improved the neovascularization following femoral artery ligation and recovery of perfusion of the ischemic limb. Taken together, these results support liposomal delivery of syndecan-4 as an effective means to improving the potential of using growth factors to achieve therapeutic neovascularization of ischemic tissue.},

The pioneering work of countless liposome researchers over almost 5 decades led to the development of important technical advances such as remote drug loading, extrusion for homogeneous size, long-circulating (PEGylated) liposomes, triggered release liposomes, liposomes containing nucleic acid polymers, ligand-targeted liposomes and liposomes containing combinations of drugs. These advances have led to numerous clinical trials in such diverse areas as the delivery of anti-cancer, anti-fungal and antibiotic drugs, the delivery of gene medicines, and the delivery of anesthetics and anti-inflammatory drugs. A number of liposomes (lipidic nanoparticles) are on the market, and many more are in the pipeline. Lipidic nanoparticles are the first nanomedicine delivery system to make the transition from concept to clinical application, and they are now an established technology platform with considerable clinical acceptance.

abstract = {Molecular chaperones are a fundamental group of proteins that have been identified only relatively recently. They are key components of a protein quality machinery in the cell which insures that the folding process of any newly-synthesized polypeptide chain results in the formation of a properly folded protein and that the folded protein is maintained in an active conformation throughout its functional lifetime. Molecular chaperones have been shown to play essential roles in cell viability under both normal and stress conditions. Chaperones can also assist in the unfolding and degradation of misfolded proteins and in disaggregating preformed protein aggregates. Chaperones are also involved in other cellular functions including protein translocation across membranes, vesicle fusion events, and protein secretion. In recent years, tremendous advances have been made in our understanding of the biology, biochemistry, and biophysics of function of molecular chaperones. In addition, recent technical developments in the fields of proteomics and genomics allowed us to obtain a global view of chaperone interaction networks. Finally, there is now a growing interest in the role of molecular chaperones in diseases. This book will provide a comprehensive analysis of the structure and function of the diverse systems of molecular chaperones and their role in cell stress responses and in diseases from a global network perspective. ‚Äã},

abstract = {The signal recognition particle (SRP) cotranslationally recognizes signal sequences of secretory proteins and targets ribosome-nascent chain complexes to the SRP receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, initiating translocation of the nascent chain through the Sec61 translocon. Although signal sequences do not have homology, they have similar structural regions: a positively charged N-terminus, a hydrophobic core and a more polar C-terminal region that contains the cleavage site for the signal peptidase. Here, we have used site-specific photocrosslinking to study SRP-signal sequence interactions. A photoreactive probe was incorporated into the middle of wild-type or mutated signal sequences of the secretory protein preprolactin by in vitro translation of mRNAs containing an amber-stop codon in the signal peptide in the presence of the N??-(5-azido-2 nitrobenzoyl)-Lys-tRNAamb amber suppressor. A homogeneous population of SRP-ribosome-nascent chain complexes was obtained by the use of truncated mRNAs in translations performed in the presence of purified canine SRP. Quantitative analysis of the photoadducts revealed that charged residues at the N-terminus of the signal sequence or in the early part of the mature protein have only a mild effect on the SRP-signal sequence association. However, deletions of amino acid residues in the hydrophobic portion of the signal sequence severely affect SRP binding. The photocrosslinking data correlate with targeting efficiency and translocation across the membrane. Thus, the hydrophobic core of the signal sequence is primarily responsible for its recognition and binding by SRP, while positive charges fine-tune the SRP-signal sequence affinity and targeting to the translocon.},

ER insertion can take place through the well-characterized signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent pathway or the less-studied route of SRP-independent translocation. To better understand the prevalence of the SRP-independent pathway, we systematically defined the translocational dependence of the yeast secretome. By combining hydropathy-based analysis and microscopy, we uncovered that a previously unappreciated fraction of the yeast secretome translocates without the aid of the SRP. Furthermore, we validated a family of SRP-independent substrates - the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins. Studying this family, we identified a determinant for ER targeting and uncovered a network of cytosolic proteins that facilitate SRP-independent targeting and translocation. These findings highlight the underappreciated complexity of SRP-independent translocation, which enables this pathway to efficiently cope with its extensive substrate flux. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A substantial proportion of the genome encodes membrane proteins that are delivered to the endoplasmic reticulum by dedicated targeting pathways. Membrane proteins that fail targeting must be rapidly degraded to avoid aggregation and disruption of cytosolic protein homeostasis. The mechanisms of mislocalized protein (MLP) degradation are unknown. Here we reconstitute MLP degradation in vitro to identify factors involved in this pathway. We find that nascent membrane proteins tethered to ribosomes are not substrates for ubiquitination unless they are released into the cytosol. Their inappropriate release results in capture by the Bag6 complex, a recently identified ribosome-associating chaperone. Bag6-complex-mediated capture depends on the presence of unprocessed or non-inserted hydrophobic domains that distinguish MLPs from potential cytosolic proteins. A subset of these Bag6 complex 'clients' are transferred to TRC40 for insertion into the membrane, whereas the remainder are rapidly ubiquitinated. Depletion of the Bag6 complex selectively impairs the efficient ubiquitination of MLPs. Thus, by its presence on ribosomes that are synthesizing nascent membrane proteins, the Bag6 complex links targeting and ubiquitination pathways. We propose that such coupling allows the fast tracking of MLPs for degradation without futile engagement of the cytosolic folding machinery.},

abstract = {The Gene Ontology (GO) offers a comprehensive and standardized way to describe a protein's biological role. Proteins are annotated with GO terms based on direct or indirect experimental evidence. Term assignments are also inferred from homology and literature mining. Regardless of the type of evidence used, GO assignments are manually curated or electronic. Unfortunately, manual curation cannot keep pace with the data, available from publications and various large experimental datasets. Automated literature-based annotation methods have been developed in order to speed up the annotation. However, they only apply to proteins that have been experimentally investigated or have close homologs with sufficient and consistent annotation. One of the homology-based electronic methods for GO annotation is provided by the InterPro database. The InterPro2GO/PFAM2GO associates individual protein domains with GO terms and thus can be used to annotate the less studied proteins. However, protein classification via a single functional domain demands stringency to avoid large number of false positives. This work broadens the basic approach. We model proteins via their entire functional domain content and train individual decision tree classifiers for each GO term using known protein assignments. We demonstrate that our approach is sensitive, specific and precise, as well as fairly robust to sparse data. We have found that our method is more sensitive when compared to the InterPro2GO performance and suffers only some precision decrease. In comparison to the InterPro2GO we have improved the sensitivity by 22{\%}, 27{\%} and 50{\%} for Molecular Function, Biological Process and Cellular GO terms respectively.},

abstract = {Motivation: Accurate prediction of contacts between $\beta$-strand residues can significantly contribute towards ab initio prediction of the 3D structure of many proteins. Contacts in the same protein are highly interdependent. Therefore, significant improvements can be expected by applying statistical relational learners that overcome the usual machine learning assumption that examples are independent and identically distributed. Furthermore, the dependencies among $\beta$-residue contacts are subject to strong regularities, many of which are known a priori. In this article, we take advantage of Markov logic, a statistical relational learning framework that is able to capture dependencies between contacts, and constrain the solution according to domain knowledge expressed by means of weighted rules in a logical language.Results: We introduce a novel hybrid architecture based on neural and Markov logic networks with grounding-specific weights. On a non-redundant dataset, our method achieves 44.9{\%} F1 measure, with 47.3{\%} precision and 42.7{\%} recall, which is significantly better (P {\textless} 0.01) than previously reported performance obtained by 2D recursive neural networks. Our approach also significantly improves the number of chains for which $\beta$-strands are nearly perfectly paired (36{\%} of the chains are predicted with F1 ‚â• 70{\%} on coarse map). It also outperforms more general contact predictors on recent CASP 2008 targets.Contact: lippi@dsi.unifi.itSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. },

abstract = {This review attempts a critical stock-taking of the current state of the science aimed at predicting structural features of proteins from their amino acid sequences. At the primary structure level, methods are considered for detection of remotely related sequences and for recognizing amino acid patterns to predict posttranslational modifications and binding sites. The techniques involving secondary structural features include prediction of secondary structure, membrane-spanning regions, and secondary structural class. At the tertiary structural level, methods for threading a sequence into a mainchain fold, homology modeling and assigning sequences to protein families with similar folds are discussed. A literature analysis suggests that, to date, threading techniques are not able to show their superiority over sequence pattern recognition methods. Recent progress in the state of ab initio structure calculation is reviewed in detail. The analysis shows that many structural features can be predicted from the amino acid sequence much better than just a few years ago and with attendant utility in experimental research. Best prediction can be achieved for new protein sequences that can be assigned to well-studied protein families. For single sequences without homologues, the folding problem has not yet been solved.},

abstract = {One strategy employed by bacterial strains to resist ??-lactam antibiotics is the expression of metallo-??-lactamases requiring Zn2+ for activity. In the last few years, many new zinc ??-lactamases have been described and several pathogens are now known to synthesize members of this class. Metallo-??-lactamases are especially worrisome due to: (1) their broad activity profiles that encompass most ??-lactam antibiotics, including the carbapenems; (2) potential for horizontal transference; and (3) the absence of clinically useful inhibitors. On the basis of the known sequences, three different lineages, identified as subclasses B1, B2, and B3 have been characterized. The three-dimensional structure of at least one metallo-??-lactamase of each subclass has been solved. These very similar 3D structures are characterized by the presence of an ????????-fold. In addition to metallo-??-lactamases which cleave the amide bond of the ??-lactam ring, the metallo-??-lactamase superfamily includes enzymes which hydrolyze thiol-ester, phosphodiester and sulfuric ester bonds as well as oxydoreductases. Most of the 6000 members of this superfamily share five conserved motifs, the most characteristic being the His116-X-His118-X-Asp120-His121 signature. They all exhibit an ????????-fold, similar to that found in the structure of zinc ??-lactamases. Many members of this superfamily are involved in mRNA maturation and DNA reparation. This fact suggests the hypothesis that metallo-??-lactamases may be the result of divergent evolution starting from an ancestral protein which did not have a ??-lactamase activity. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The expansion of functions in an enzyme superfamily is thought to occur through recruitment of latent promiscuous functions within existing enzymes. Thus, the promiscuous activities of enzymes represent connections between different catalytic landscapes and provide an additional layer of evolutionary connectivity between functional families alongside their sequence and structural relationships. Functional connectivity has been observed between individual functional families; however, little is known about how catalytic landscapes are connected throughout a highly diverged superfamily. Here, we describe a superfamily-wide analysis of evolutionary and functional connectivity in the metallo-??-lactamase (MBL) superfamily. We investigated evolutionary connections between functional families and related evolutionary to functional connectivity; 24 enzymes from 15 distinct functional families were challenged against 10 catalytically distinct reactions. We revealed that enzymes of this superfamily are generally promiscuous, as each enzyme catalyzes on average 1.5 reactions in addition to its native one. Catalytic landscapes in the MBL superfamily overlap substantially; each reaction is connected on average to 3.7 other reactions whereas some connections appear to be unrelated to recent evolutionary events and occur between chemically distinct reactions. These findings support the idea that the highly distinct reactions in the MBL superfamily could have evolved from a common ancestor traversing a continuous network via promiscuous enzymes. Several functional connections (e.g., the lactonase/phosphotriesterase and phosphonatase/phosphodiesterase/arylsulfatase reactions) are also observed in structurally and evolutionary distinct superfamilies, suggesting that these catalytic landscapes are substantially connected. Our results show that new enzymatic functions could evolve rapidly from the current diversity of enzymes and range of promiscuous activities. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Erythromycin resistance in Campylobacter coli from meat animals is frequently encountered and could represent a substantial barrier to antibiotic treatment of human infections. Erythromycin resistance in this organism has been associated with a point mutation (A2075G) in the 23S rRNA gene. However, the mechanisms responsible for possible dissemination of erythromycin resistance in C. coli remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated transformation-mediated acquisition of erythromycin resistance by genotypically diverse C. coli strains from turkeys and swine, with total genomic DNA from erythromycin-resistant C. coli of either turkey or swine origin used as a donor. Overall, transformation to erythromycin resistance was significantly more frequent in C. coli strains from turkeys than in swine-derived strains (P 256 mu g/ml), as did the C. coli donor strains. In contrast to the results obtained with transformation, spontaneous mutants had relatively low erythromycin MICs (32 to 64 mu g/ml) and lacked the A2075G mutation in the 23S rRNA gene. These findings suggest that natural transformation has the potential to contribute to the dissemination of high-level resistance to erythromycin among C. coli strains colonizing meat animals.},

We have exploited this natural plasticity to engineer a new class of non-immunoglobulin alternatives to antibodies with unique structural and biophysical characteristics. We present here the engineering of the OB-fold anticodon recognition domain from aspartyl tRNA synthetase taken from the thermophile Pyrobaculum aerophilum. For this single-domain scaffold we have coined the term OBody. Starting from a na{\"{i}}ve combinatorial library, we engineered an OBody with 3 nM affinity for hen egg-white lysozyme, by optimising the affinity of a na{\"{i}}ve OBody 11,700-fold over several affinity maturation steps, using phage display. At each maturation step a crystal structure of the engineered OBody in complex with hen egg-white lysozyme was determined, showing binding elements in atomic detail. These structures have given us an unprecedented insight into the directed evolution of affinity for a single antigen on the molecular scale. The engineered OBodies retain the high thermal stability of the parental OB-fold despite mutation of up to 22{\%} of their residues. They can be expressed in soluble form and also purified from bacteria at high yields. They also lack disulfide bonds. These data demonstrate the potential of OBodies as a new scaffold for the engineering of specific binding reagents and provide a platform for further development of future OBody-based applications.},

abstract = {The crystal structure of the synthetic DNA dodecamer d(CpGpCpGpApApTpTpCpGpCpG) has been refined to a residual error of R = 17.8{\%} at 1.9-A resolution (two-sigma data). The molecule forms slightly more than one complete turn of right-handed double-stranded B helix. The two ends of the helix overlap and interlock minor grooves with neighboring molecules up and down a 2(1) screw axis, producing a 19 degrees bend in helix axis over the 11-base-pair steps of the dodecamer. In the center of the molecule, where perturbation is least, the helix has a mean rotation of 36.9 degrees per step, or 9.8 base pairs per turn. The mean propeller twist (total dihedral angle between base planes) between A . T base pairs in the center of the molecule is 17.3 degrees, and that between C . G pairs on the two ends averages 11.5 degrees. Individual deoxyribose ring conformations as measured by the C5'-C4'-C3'-O3' torsion angle delta, exhibit an approximately Gaussian distribution centered around the C1'-exo position with delta avg = 123 degrees and a range of 79 degrees to 157 degrees. Purine sugars cluster at high delta values, and pyrimidine sugars cluster at lower delta. A tendency toward 2-fold symmetry in sugar conformation about the center of the molecule is detectable in spite of the destruction of ideal 2-fold symmetry by the molecular bending. More strikingly, sugar conformations of paired based appear to follow a "principle of anticorrelation," with delta values lying approximately the same distance to either side of the center value, delta = 123 degrees. This same anticorrelation is also observed in other DNA and DNA . RNA structures.},

abstract = {Natural genetic transformation is the active uptake of free DNA by bacterial cells and the heritable incorporation of its genetic information. Since the famous discovery of transformation in Streptococcus pneumoniae by Griffith in 1928 and the demonstration of DNA as the transforming principle by Avery and coworkers in 1944, cellular processes involved in transformation have been studied extensively by in vitro experimentation with a few transformable species. Only more recently has it been considered that transformation may be a powerful mechanism of horizontal gene transfer in natural bacterial populations. In this review the current understanding of the biology of transformation is summarized to provide the platform on which aspects of bacterial transformation in water, soil, and sediments and the habitat of pathogens are discussed. Direct and indirect evidence for gene transfer routes by transformation within species and between different species will be presented, along with data suggesting that plasmids as well as chromosomal DNA are subject to genetic exchange via transformation. Experiments exploring the prerequisites for transformation in the environment, including the production and persistence of free DNA and factors important for the uptake of DNA by cells, will be compiled, as well as possible natural barriers to transformation. The efficiency of gene transfer by transformation in bacterial habitats is possibly genetically adjusted to submaximal levels. The fact that natural transformation has been detected among bacteria from all trophic and taxonomic groups including archaebacteria suggests that transformability evolved early in phylogeny. Probable functions of DNA uptake other than gene acquisition will be discussed. The body of information presently available suggests that transformation has a great impact on bacterial population dynamics as well as on bacterial evolution and speciation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identification of DNA-binding proteins is one of the major challenges in the field of genome annotation, as these proteins play a crucial role in gene-regulation. In this paper, we developed various SVM modules for predicting DNA-binding domains and proteins. All models were trained and tested on multiple datasets of non-redundant proteins. RESULTS: SVM models have been developed on DNAaset, which consists of 1153 DNA-binding and equal number of non DNA-binding proteins, and achieved the maximum accuracy of 72.42{\%} and 71.59{\%} using amino acid and dipeptide compositions, respectively. The performance of SVM model improved from 72.42{\%} to 74.22{\%}, when evolutionary information in form of PSSM profiles was used as input instead of amino acid composition. In addition, SVM models have been developed on DNAset, which consists of 146 DNA-binding and 250 non-binding chains/domains, and achieved the maximum accuracy of 79.80{\%} and 86.62{\%} using amino acid composition and PSSM profiles. The SVM models developed in this study perform better than existing methods on a blind dataset. CONCLUSION: A highly accurate method has been developed for predicting DNA-binding proteins using SVM and PSSM profiles. This is the first study in which evolutionary information in form of PSSM profiles has been used successfully for predicting DNA-binding proteins.

abstract = {Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are synthesized as part of longer primary transcripts that require processing of both their 3' and 5' extremities in every living organism known. The 5' side is processed (matured) by the ubiquitously conserved endonucleolytic ribozyme, RNase P, whereas removal of the 3' tails can be either exonucleolytic or endonucleolytic. The endonucleolytic pathway is catalysed by an enzyme known as RNase Z, or 3' tRNase. RNase Z cleaves precursor tRNAs immediately after the discriminator base (the unpaired nucleotide 3' to the last base pair of the acceptor stem, used as an identity determinant by many aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases) in most cases, yielding a tRNA primed for addition of the CCA motif by nucleotidyl transferase. Here we report the crystal structure of Bacillus subtilis RNase Z at 2.1 A resolution, and propose a mechanism for tRNA recognition and cleavage. The structure explains the allosteric properties of the enzyme, and also sheds light on the mechanisms of inhibition by the CCA motif and long 5' extensions. Finally, it highlights the extraordinary adaptability of the metallo-hydrolase domain of the beta-lactamase family for the hydrolysis of covalent bonds.},

Users can also retrieve glycan tree structures in KCF format from their local computers for visualization over the web. The tree-matching algorithm provides several options for performing different types of tree-matching procedures on glycans.

The results of this program are returned as a list of glycan structures in order of similarity based on these options. The actual alignment can be viewed graphically, and the annotation information can also be viewed easily since all this information is linked with KEGG's comprehensive suite of genomic data. Analogously to BLAST, users are thus able to compare glycan structures of interest with glycans from different glycan databases using a variety of tree-alignment options.

Here, we demonstrate two types of chemical structure search servers: SIMCOMP (http://www.genome.jp/tools/simcomp/) for the chemical similarity search and SUBCOMP (http://www.genome.jp/tools/subcomp/) for the chemical substructure search, where both servers provide links to the KEGG PATHWAY and BRITE databases. The SIMCOMP is a graph-based method for searching the maximal common subgraph isomorphism by finding the maximal cliques in the association graph. In contrast, the SUBCOMP is an extended method for solving the subgraph isomorphism problem. The obtained links to PATHWAY or BRITE databases can be used to interpret as the biological meanings of chemical structures from the viewpoint of the various biological functions including metabolic networks.},

abstract = {The identification of orthologous genes in an increasing number of fully sequenced genomes is a challenging issue in recent genome science. Here we present KEGG OC (http://www.genome.jp/tools/oc/), a novel database of ortholog clusters (OCs). The current version of KEGG OC contains 1 176 030 OCs, obtained by clustering 8 357 175 genes in 2112 complete genomes (153 eukaryotes, 1830 bacteria and 129 archaea). The OCs were constructed by applying the quasi-clique-based clustering method to all possible protein coding genes in all complete genomes, based on their amino acid sequence similarities. It is computationally efficient to calculate OCs, which enables to regularly update the contents. KEGG OC has the following two features: (i) It consists of all complete genomes of a wide variety of organisms from three domains of life, and the number of organisms is the largest among the existing databases; and (ii) It is compatible with the KEGG database by sharing the same sets of genes and identifiers, which leads to seamless integration of OCs with useful components in KEGG such as biological pathways, pathway modules, functional hierarchy, diseases and drugs. The KEGG OC resources are accessible via OC Viewer that provides an interactive visualization of OCs at different taxonomic levels.},

In the KEGG database, genes in complete genomes are annotated with the KEGG orthology (KO) identifiers, or the K numbers, based on the best hit information using Smith-Waterman scores as well as by the manual curation. Each K number represents an ortholog group of genes, and it is directly linked to an object in the KEGG pathway map or the BRITE functional hierarchy. Here, we have developed a web-based server called KAAS (KEGG Automatic Annotation Server: http://www.genome.jp/kegg/kaas/) i.e. an implementation of a rapid method to automatically assign K numbers to genes in the genome, enabling reconstruction of KEGG pathways and BRITE hierarchies. The method is based on sequence similarities, bi-directional best hit information and some heuristics, and has achieved a high degree of accuracy when compared with the manually curated KEGG GENES database.},

abstract = {A novel genetic determinant (comA) has been identified and found to be required for the transformation of piliated Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Mutants in comA of strain MS11 grow normally and are DNA-uptake proficient but blocked in the translocation of DNA into the cytoplasm. Here we show by site-specific mutagenesis and genetic complementation that only one of two open reading frames identified in comA is essential for competence: it encodes a protein (ComA) with a predicted size of 74 kDa. The comA gene maps upstream of the iga locus and is transcribed in the opposite orientation, probably under the control of a putative sigma 54-type promoter. While DNA probes specific for the N. gonorrhoeae iga locus reveal only a little cross-reactivity with commensal Neisseria species, the neighbouring comA gene appears to be present in most of them. ComA fusion proteins were obtained by in vitro translation. The synthesized gene products migrated atypically in SDS gels indicating its strong hydrophobicity. Several transmembrane alpha-helices were predicted from the amino acid sequence of ComA which, in the context of an observed sequence similarity with other inner membrane proteins, suggests a location for the protein in the inner membrane. Using piliated and non-piliated comA mutants the consequences of transformation deficiency on pilin phase variation were assessed. We show that the comA defect affects some but not all types of DNA rearrangements associated with pilE variation. The results are in agreement with previous observations supporting the notion that multiple recombination pathways contribute to the variability of pilE.},

abstract = {Although more than a dozen new proteins are produced when Streptococcus pneumoniae cells become competent for genetic transformation, only a few of the corresponding genes have been identified to date. To find genes responsible for the production of competence-specific proteins, a random lacZ transcriptional fusion library was constructed in S. pneumoniae by using the insertional lacZ reporter vector pEVP3. Screening the library for clones with competence-specific beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) production yielded three insertion mutants with induced beta-Gal levels of about 4, 10, and 40 Miller units. In all three clones, activation of the lacZ reporter correlated with competence and depended on competence-stimulating peptide. Chromosomal loci adjacent to the integrated vector were subcloned from the insertion mutants, and their nucleotide sequences were determined. Genes at two of the loci exhibited strong similarity to parts of Bacillus subtilis com operons. One locus contained open reading frames (ORFs) homologous to the comEA and comEC genes in B. subtilis but lacked a comEB homolog. A second locus contained four ORFs with homology to the B. subtilis comG gene ORFs 1 to 4, but comG gene ORFs 5 to 7 were replaced in S. pneumoniae with an ORF encoding a protein homologous to transport ATP-binding proteins. Genes at all three loci were confirmed to be required for transformation by mutagenesis using pEVP3 for insertion duplications or an erm cassette for gene disruptions.},

abstract = {Clobins have remarkable sequence diversity, and yet maintain a common fold. In spite of the diversity, there are highly-conserved residues at several sites. The conserved residues were examined in terms of the structural stability, by employing the pseudo-energy functions of the structure/sequence compatibility method. The fitness of each residue type to the structural environment was evaluated at seven highly-conserved sites: the Leu (at the B10 site), Phe (CD1), and Leu (F4) residues were found to fit their respective sites due to hydrophobic interactions; Pro (C2) stabilizes the N-terminal edge of an ??-helical structure; and Phe (CD4) is stabilized by backbone hydrogen-bonding to Phe (CD1). On the other hand, the other two residues, His (E7) and His (F8), are poorly suited to the sites from a structural viewpoint, suggesting that their conservation clearly results from a heme-related functional requirement. The invariant Phe residue (CD1) has been suggested to be important for supporting the heme. The present analysis revealed that this residue is also well suited to the site in terms of energy.},

We computed 480 candidate features for identifying protein residues that bind DNA, including new features that capture the electrostatic microenvironment within shells near the protein surface. Our iterative feature selection process identified features important in other models, as well as features unique to the DBSI model, such as a banded electrostatic feature with spatial separation comparable with the canonical width of the DNA minor groove. Validations and comparisons with established methods using a range of performance metrics clearly demonstrate the predictive advantage of DBSI, and its comparable performance on unbound (APO-29) and bound (HOLO-30) conformations demonstrates robustness to binding-induced protein conformational changes. Finally, we offer our feature data table to others for integration into their own models or for testing improved feature selection and model training strategies based on DBSI.},

abstract = {Genetic transformation is widely utilized in molecular biology as a tool for gene cloning in Escherichia coli and for gene mapping in Bacillus subtilis. Several strains of eubacteria can naturally take up exogenous DNA and integrate the DNA into their own genomes. Molecular details of natural transformation, however, remained to be elucidated. The complete genome of a cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, has been sequenced. This bacterium has been used to examine functions of a particular gene. The genome is considered to carry information on natural transformable characteristics of Synechocystis. The first step in genetic transformation is the uptake of exogenous DNA. Proteins with non-specific DNA binding features are required, because specificity in the exogenous DNA has not been demonstrated. Such proteins have modules interacting with the phosphate backbone of DNA, including helix-turn-helix modules. Using a consensus pattern of the phosphate-binding helix-turn-helix module, we searched through the genome data of Synechocystis for genes or open reading frame (ORF) products with the pattern in primary structures. We found that an ORF, slr0197, has the pattern in duplicate at the C-terminal region. We also found that the ORF product has a hydrophobic segment at the N-terminal region, which is followed by two internal repeats of the endonuclease domain. Based on these observations, we propose a model for the initial stage of genetic transformation. This is apparently the first report on molecular mechanisms of natural transformation.},

abstract = {Proteins required for transformation of Bacillus subtilis and other competent bacteria are associated with the membrane or reside in the cytosol. Previous work has shown that RecA, ComGA, ComFA and SsbB are directed to the cell poles in competent cells, and that the uptake of transforming DNA occurs preferentially at the poles. We show that ComGA, ComFA, DprA (Smf), SsbB (YwpH), RecA and YjbF (CoiA) are located at the cell poles, where they appear to colocalize. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we have shown that these six competent (Com) proteins reside in close proximity to one another. This conclusion was supported by the effects of com gene knockouts on the stabilities of Com proteins. Data obtained from the com gene knockout studies, as well as information from other sources, extend the list of proteins in the transformation complex to include ComEC and ComEA. Because ComGA and ComFA are membrane-associated, while DprA, SsbB, RecA and YjbF are soluble, a picture emerges of a large multiprotein polar complex, involving both cytosolic and membrane proteins. This complex mediates the binding and uptake of single-stranded DNA, the protection of this DNA from cellular nucleases and its recombination with the recipient chromosome.},

abstract = {In a working model for the uptake of transforming DNA based on evidence taken from both Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus pneumoniae, the ComG proteins are proposed to form a structure that provides access for DNA to the ComEA receptor through the peptidoglycan. DNA would then be delivered to the ComEC-ComFA transport complex. A DNA strand would be degraded by a nuclease, while its complement is pulled into the cell by ComFA through an aqueous pore formed by ComEC. The nuclease is known in S. pneumoniae only as EndA. We have examined the processing (i.e. binding, degradation and internalization) of DNA in S. pneumoniae strains lacking candidate uptake proteins. Mutants were generated by transposon insertion in endA, comEA/C, comFA/C, comGA and dprA. Processing of DNA was abolished only in a comGA mutant. As significant binding was measured in comEA mutants, we suggest the existence of two stages in binding: surface attachment (abolished in a comGA mutant) required for and preceding deep binding (by ComEA). Abolition of degradation in comGA and comEA mutants indicated that, despite its membrane location, EndA cannot access donor DNA by itself. We propose that ComEA is required to deliver DNA to EndA. DNA was still bound and degraded in comEC and comFA mutants. We conclude that recruitment of EndA can occur in the absence of ComEC or ComFA and that EndA is active even when the single strands it produces are not pulled into the cell. Finally, inactivation of dprA had no effect on the internalization of DNA, indicating that DprA is required at a later stage in transformation.},

The FtsK/SpoIIIE proteins carry out the translocation of double-stranded DNA to ensure complete chromosome segregation during cell division. In contrast, the complex molecular machines that mediate conjugation and genetic transformation drive the transport of single stranded DNA. The transformation machine also processes this internalized DNA and mediates its recombination with the resident chromosome during and after uptake, whereas the conjugation apparatus processes DNA before transfer. This article reviews these three types of DNA pumps, with attention to what is understood of their molecular mechanisms, their energetics and their cellular localizations.},

The proteins involved in mediating various steps in these pathways are described, and models for the transformation mechanisms are presented. Uptake of DNA across the inner membrane is probably similar in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and at least some of the required proteins are orthologs. The initial transformation steps differ, as expected, from the presence of an outer membrane only in the gram-negative organisms. The similarity of certain essential competence proteins to those required for the assembly of type-4 pili and for type-2 protein secretion is discussed. Finally several hypotheses for the biological role of transformation are presented and evaluated.},

Membrane topology studies suggest a model of ComEC as a multispanning membrane protein with seven transmembrane segments (TMSs), and possibly with one laterally inserted amphipathic helix. We show that ComEC contains an intramolecular disulphide bond in its N-terminal extracellular loop (between the residues C131 and C172), which is required for the stability of the protein, and is probably introduced by BdbDC, a pair of competence-induced oxidoreductase proteins. By in vitro cross-linking using native cysteine residues we show that ComEC forms an oligomer. The oligomerization surface includes a transmembrane segment, TMS-G, near the cytoplasmic C-terminus of ComEC.},

Two additional ComE binding sites were identified in the pneumococcal genome, one in the promoter region of comAB and the other upstream of an ABC transporter of unknown function. A comparison of the ComE-binding sequences with the sequence motif previously found to be involved in the co-ordinated expression of the late genes revealed that they are unrelated. These findings indicate that ComE activates transcription of the late genes indirectly, i.e. via one or more intermediate factors.},

abstract = {A Bacillus subtilis gene, required for genetic competence, was identified immediately upstream from the previously characterized gene comA. The comA gene product has been found to exhibit amino acid sequence similarity to the so-called effector class of signal-transduction proteins. DNA sequencing of the new determinant, named comP, revealed that the carboxy-terminal domain of the predicted ComP protein is similar in amino acid sequence to that of several sensor members of the bacterial two-component signal-transduction systems. The predicted amino-terminal domain contains several hydrophobic segments, postulated to be membrane-spanning. In vitro-derived comP disruptions are epistatic on the expression of all late competence genes tested, including comG, comC, comD, and comE, but not on expression of the early gene comB. Although comA has its own promoter, some transcription of comA, especially later in growth, occurs via readthrough from comP sequences. A roughly twofold epistatic effect of a comP disruption was noted on the downstream comA determinant, possibly due to interruption of readthrough transcription from comP to comA. Overexpression of comA fully restored competence to a comP mutant, providing evidence that ComA acts after ComP, and consistent with a role for the latter protein in activation of the former, possibly by phosphorylation. ComP probably is involved in transmitting information concerning the nutritional status of the medium, particularly the presence of nitrogen- and carbon-containing nutrients. ComP was also shown to play a role in sporulation, at least partly interchangeable with that of SpoIIJ, another putative sensor protein.},

A minor promoter also is responsible for transcription of ORF2 and -3. A transcript containing a single ORF is produced in the reverse direction. The reverse ORF overlaps ORF1 and the untranslated comE leader. The comE transcript is present at a very low level during growth and at an elevated level in stationary-phase cells. Conversely, the reverse transcript is present during exponential growth and disappears during stationary phase. The reverse ORF resembles prokaryotic and eukaryotic pyrroline-5'-carboxylate reductases, while ORF2 is similar to several dCMP deaminases.
