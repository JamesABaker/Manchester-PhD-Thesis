abstract = {The first closed bilayer phospholipid systems, called liposomes, were described in 1965 and soon were proposed as drug delivery systems. The pioneering work of countless liposome researchers over almost 5 decades led to the development of important technical advances such as remote drug loading, extrusion for homogeneous size, long-circulating (PEGylated) liposomes, triggered release liposomes, liposomes containing nucleic acid polymers, ligand-targeted liposomes and liposomes containing combinations of drugs. These advances have led to numerous clinical trials in such diverse areas as the delivery of anti-cancer, anti-fungal and antibiotic drugs, the delivery of gene medicines, and the delivery of anesthetics and anti-inflammatory drugs. A number of liposomes (lipidic nanoparticles) are on the market, and many more are in the pipeline. Lipidic nanoparticles are the first nanomedicine delivery system to make the transition from concept to clinical application, and they are now an established technology platform with considerable clinical acceptance. We can look forward to many more clinical products in the future. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Membrane proteins form key nodes in mediating the cell's interaction with the surroundings, which is one of the main reasons why the majority of drug targets are membrane proteins. RESULTS: Here we mined the human proteome and identified the membrane proteome subset using three prediction tools for alpha-helices: Phobius, TMHMM, and SOSUI. This dataset was reduced to a non-redundant set by aligning it to the human genome and then clustered with our own interactive implementation of the ISODATA algorithm. The genes were classified and each protein group was manually curated, virtually evaluating each sequence of the clusters, applying systematic comparisons with a range of databases and other resources. We identified 6,718 human membrane proteins and classified the majority of them into 234 families of which 151 belong to the three major functional groups: receptors (63 groups, 1,352 members), transporters (89 groups, 817 members) or enzymes (7 groups, 533 members). Also, 74 miscellaneous groups with 697 members were determined. Interestingly, we find that 41{\%} of the membrane proteins are singlets with no apparent affiliation or identity to any human protein family. Our results identify major differences between the human membrane proteome and the ones in unicellular organisms and we also show a strong bias towards certain membrane topologies for different functional classes: 77{\%} of all transporters have more than six helices while 60{\%} of proteins with an enzymatic function and 88{\%} receptors, that are not GPCRs, have only one single membrane spanning alpha-helix. Further, we have identified and characterized new gene families and novel members of existing families. CONCLUSION: Here we present the most detailed roadmap of gene numbers and families to our knowledge, which is an important step towards an overall classification of the entire human proteome. We estimate that 27{\%} of the total human proteome are alpha-helical transmembrane proteins and provide an extended classification together with in-depth investigations of the membrane proteome's functional, structural, and evolutionary features.},

Inactive EGFR can exist as both monomers and dimers, suggesting that the mechanism regulating EGFR activity may be subtle. The membrane itself may play a role but creates substantial difficulties for structural studies. Our molecular dynamics simulations of membrane-embedded EGFR suggest that, in ligand-bound dimers, the extracellular domains assume conformations favoring dimerization of the transmembrane helices near their N termini, dimerization of the juxtamembrane segments, and formation of asymmetric (active) kinase dimers. In ligand-free dimers, by holding apart the N termini of the transmembrane helices, the extracellular domains instead favor C-terminal dimerization of the transmembrane helices, juxtamembrane segment dissociation and membrane burial, and formation of symmetric (inactive) kinase dimers. Electrostatic interactions of EGFR's intracellular module with the membrane are critical in maintaining this coupling.},

abstract = {Translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an initial and crucial biogenesis step for all secreted and endomembrane proteins in eukaryotes. ER insertion can take place through the well-characterized signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent pathway or the less-studied route of SRP-independent translocation. To better understand the prevalence of the SRP-independent pathway, we systematically defined the translocational dependence of the yeast secretome. By combining hydropathy-based analysis and microscopy, we uncovered that a previously unappreciated fraction of the yeast secretome translocates without the aid of the SRP. Furthermore, we validated a family of SRP-independent substrates - the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins. Studying this family, we identified a determinant for ER targeting and uncovered a network of cytosolic proteins that facilitate SRP-independent targeting and translocation. These findings highlight the underappreciated complexity of SRP-independent translocation, which enables this pathway to efficiently cope with its extensive substrate flux. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Recent advances in determination of the high-resolution structure of membrane proteins now enable analysis of the main features of amino acids in transmembrane (TM) segments in comparison with amino acids in water-soluble helices. In this work, we conducted a large-scale analysis of the prevalent locations of amino acids by using a data set of 170 structures of integral membrane proteins obtained from the MPtopo database and 930 structures of water-soluble helical proteins obtained from the protein data bank. Large hydrophobic amino acids (Leu, Val, Ile, and Phe) plus Gly were clearly prevalent in TM helices whereas polar amino acids (Glu, Lys, Asp, Arg, and Gln) were less frequent in this type of helix. The distribution of amino acids along TM helices was also examined. As expected, hydrophobic and slightly polar amino acids are commonly found in the hydrophobic core of the membrane whereas aromatic (Trp and Tyr), Pro, and the hydrophilic amino acids (Asn, His, and Gln) occur more frequently in the interface regions. Charged amino acids are also statistically prevalent outside the hydrophobic core of the membrane, and whereas acidic amino acids are frequently found at both cytoplasmic and extra-cytoplasmic interfaces, basic amino acids cluster at the cytoplasmic interface. These results strongly support the experimentally demonstrated biased distribution of positively charged amino acids (that is, the so-called the positive-inside rule) with structural data.},

abstract = {$\alpha$-Helical hairpins, consisting of a pair of closely spaced transmembrane (TM) helices that are connected by a short interfacial turn, are the simplest structural motifs found in multi-spanning membrane proteins. In naturally occurring hairpins, the presence of polar residues is common and predicted to complicate membrane insertion. We postulate that the pre-packing process offsets any energetic cost of allocating polar and charged residues within the hydrophobic environment of biological membranes. Consistent with this idea, we provide here experimental evidence demonstrating that helical hairpin insertion into biological membranes can be driven by electrostatic interactions between closely separated, poorly hydrophobic sequences. Additionally, we observe that the integral hairpin can be stabilized by a short loop heavily populated by turn-promoting residues. We conclude that the combined effect of TM-TM electrostatic interactions and tight turns plays an important role in generating the functional architecture of membrane proteins and propose that helical hairpin motifs can be acquired within the context of the Sec61 translocon at the early stages of membrane protein biosynthesis. Taken together, these data further underline the potential complexities involved in accurately predicting TM domains from primary structures. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We report the crystal structure of the complex from Methanococcus jannaschii at a resolution of 3.2 {\AA}. The structure suggests that one copy of the heterotrimer serves as a functional translocation channel. The $\alpha$-subunit has two linked halves, transmembrane segments 1–5 and 6–10, clamped together by the $\gamma$-subunit. A cytoplasmic funnel leading into the channel is plugged by a short helix. Plug displacement can open the channel into an ‘hourglass' with a ring of hydrophobic residues at its constriction. This ring may form a seal around the translocating polypeptide, hindering the permeation of other molecules. The structure also suggests mechanisms for signal-sequence recognition and for the lateral exit of transmembrane segments of nascent membrane proteins into lipid, and indicates binding sites for partners that provide the driving force for translocation.},

abstract = {Although transmembrane proteins generally require membrane-embedded machinery for integration, a few can insert spontaneously into liposomes. Previously, we established that the tail-anchored (TA) protein cytochrome b(5) (b5) can posttranslationally translocate 28 residues downstream to its transmembrane domain (TMD) across protein-free bilayers (Brambillasca, S., M. Yabal, P. Soffientini, S. Stefanovic, M. Makarow, R.S. Hegde, and N. Borgese. 2005. EMBO J. 24:2533-2542). In the present study, we investigated the limits of this unassisted translocation and report that surprisingly long (85 residues) domains of different sequence and charge placed downstream of b5's TMD can posttranslationally translocate into mammalian microsomes and liposomes at nanomolar nucleotide concentrations. Furthermore, integration of these constructs occurred in vivo in translocon-defective yeast strains. Unassisted translocation was not unique to b5 but was also observed for another TA protein (protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B) whose TMD, like the one of b5, is only moderately hydrophobic. In contrast, more hydrophobic TMDs, like synaptobrevin's, were incapable of supporting unassisted integration, possibly because of their tendency to aggregate in aqueous solution. Our data resolve long-standing discrepancies on TA protein insertion and are relevant to membrane evolution, biogenesis, and physiology.},

The posttranslational targeting of the important tail-anchor membrane (TA) proteins has recently been under intense investigation. A specialized pathway, called the guided entry of TA proteins (GET) pathway in yeast and the transmembrane domain recognition complex (TRC) pathway in vertebrates, recognizes endoplasmic-reticulum-targeted TA proteins and delivers them through a complex series of handoffs. An early step is the formation of a complex between Sgt2/SGTA, a cochaperone with a presumed ubiquitin-like-binding domain (UBD), and Get5/UBL4A, a ubiquitin-like domain (UBL)-containing protein. We structurally characterize this UBD/UBL interaction for both yeast and human proteins. This characterization is supported by biophysical studies that demonstrate that complex formation is mediated by electrostatics, generating an interface that has high-affinity with rapid kinetics. In total, this work provides a refined model of the interplay of Sgt2 homologs in TA targeting.},

abstract = {The biogenesis, folding, and structure of ??-helical membrane proteins (MPs) are important to understand because they underlie virtually all physiological processes in cells including key metabolic pathways, such as the respiratory chain and the photosystems, as well as the transport of solutes and signals across membranes. Nearly all MPs require translocons - often referred to as protein-conducting channels - for proper insertion into their target membrane. Remarkable progress toward understanding the structure and functioning of translocons has been made during the past decade. Here, we review and assess this progress critically. All available evidence indicates that MPs are equilibrium structures that achieve their final structural states by folding along thermodynamically controlled pathways. The main challenge for cells is the targeting and membrane insertion of highly hydrophobic amino acid sequences. Targeting and insertion are managed in cells principally by interactions between ribosomes and membrane-embedded translocons. Our review examines the biophysical and biological boundaries of MP insertion and the folding of polytopic MPs in vivo. A theme of the review is the under-appreciated role of basic thermodynamic principles in MP folding and assembly. Thermodynamics not only dictates the final folded structure but also is the driving force for the evolution of the ribosome-translocon system of assembly. We conclude the review with a perspective suggesting a new view of translocon-guided MP insertion.},

abstract = {Biological membranes are characterized by a heterogeneous composition, which is not only manifested in the wide variety of their components, but also in aspects like the lateral organization, topology, and conformation of proteins and lipids. In bringing about the correct membrane structure, protein-lipid interactions can be expected to play a prominent role. The extent of hydrophobic matching between transmembrane protein segments and lipids potentially constitutes a versatile director of membrane organization, because a tendency to avoid hydrophobic mismatch could result in compensating adaptations such as tilt of the transmembrane segment or segregation into distinct domains. Also, interfacial interactions between lipid headgroups and the aromatic and charged residues that typically flank transmembrane domains may act as an organizing element. In this review, we discuss the numerous model studies that have systematically explored the influence of hydrophobic matching and interfacial anchoring on membrane structure. Designed peptides consisting of a polyleucine or polyleucine/alanine hydrophobic stretch, which is flanked on both sides by tryptophan or lysine residues, reflect the general layout of transmembrane protein segments. It is shown for phosphatidylcholine bilayers and for other model membranes that these peptides adapt a transmembrane topology without extensive peptide or lipid adaptations under conditions of hydrophobic matching, but that significant rearrangements can result from hydrophobic mismatch. Moreover, these effects depend on the nature of the flanking residues, implying a modulation of the mismatch response by interfacial interactions of the flanking residues. The implications of these model studies for the organization of biomembranes are discussed in the context of recent experiments with more complex systems.},

@article{Demirci2013,
abstract = {The Sec61 translocon forms a pore to translocate polypeptide sequences across the membrane and offers a lateral gate for membrane integration of hydrophobic (H) segments. A central constriction of six apolar residues has been shown to form a seal, but also to determine the hydrophobicity threshold for membrane integration: Mutation of these residues in yeast Sec61p to glycines, serines, aspartates, or lysines lowered the hydrophobicity required for integration; mutation to alanines increased it. Whereas four leucines distributed in an oligo-alanine H segment were sufficient for 50{\%} integration, we now find four leucines in the N-terminal half of the H segment to produce significantly more integration than in the C-terminal half, suggesting functional asymmetry within the translocon. Scanning a cluster of three leucines through an oligo-alanine H segment showed high integration levels, except around the position matching that of the hydrophobic constriction in the pore where integration was strongly reduced. Both asymmetry and the position effect of H-segment integration disappeared upon mutation of the constriction residues to glycines or serines, demonstrating that hydrophobicity at this position within the translocon is responsible for the phenomenon. Asymmetry was largely retained, however, when constriction residues were replaced by alanines. These results reflect on the integration mechanism of transmembrane domains and show that membrane insertion of H segments strongly depends not only on their intrinsic hydrophobicity but also on the local conditions in the translocon interior. Thus, the contribution of hydrophobic residues in the H segment is not simply additive and displays cooperativeness depending on their relative position.},

Recently, we have updated TOPDB from several sources and utilized a newly developed topology prediction algorithm to determine the most reliable topology using the results of experiments as constraints. In addition to collecting the experimentally determined topology data published in the last couple of years, we gathered topographies defined by the TMDET algorithm using 3D structures from the PDBTM. Results of global topology analysis of various organisms as well as topology data generated by high throughput techniques, like the sequential positions of N- or O-glycosylations were incorporated into the TOPDB database. Moreover, a new algorithm was developed to integrate scattered topology data from various publicly available databases and a new method was introduced to measure the reliability of predicted topologies. We show that reliability values highly correlate with the per protein topology accuracy of the utilized prediction method. Altogether, more than 52 000 new topology data and more than 2600 new transmembrane proteins have been collected since the last public release of the TOPDB database.},

@article{Eisenhaber1995,
abstract = {This review attempts a critical stock-taking of the current state of the science aimed at predicting structural features of proteins from their amino acid sequences. At the primary structure level, methods are considered for detection of remotely related sequences and for recognizing amino acid patterns to predict posttranslational modifications and binding sites. The techniques involving secondary structural features include prediction of secondary structure, membrane-spanning regions, and secondary structural class. At the tertiary structural level, methods for threading a sequence into a mainchain fold, homology modeling and assigning sequences to protein families with similar folds are discussed. A literature analysis suggests that, to date, threading techniques are not able to show their superiority over sequence pattern recognition methods. Recent progress in the state of ab initio structure calculation is reviewed in detail. The analysis shows that many structural features can be predicted from the amino acid sequence much better than just a few years ago and with attendant utility in experimental research. Best prediction can be achieved for new protein sequences that can be assigned to well-studied protein families. For single sequences without homologues, the folding problem has not yet been solved.

However, other structural elements, as yet largely ignored in statistical studies of membrane protein structure, are found in those parts of the protein that are located in the membrane-water interface region. Here, we show that this region is enriched in irregular structure and in interfacial helices running roughly parallel with the membrane surface, while ??-strands are extremely rare. The average amino acid composition is different between the interfacial helices, the parts of the transmembrane helices located in the interface region, and the irregular structures. In this region, hydrophobic and aromatic residues tend to point toward the membrane and charged/polar residues tend to point away from the membrane. The interface region thus imposes different constraints on protein structure than do the central hydrocarbon core of the membrane and the surrounding aqueous phase. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In mammalian cells, most integral membrane proteins are initially inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by the so-called Sec61 translocon. However, recent predictions suggest that many transmembrane helices (TMHs) in multispanning membrane proteins are not sufficiently hydrophobic to be recognized as such by the translocon. In this study, we have screened 16 marginally hydrophobic TMHs from membrane proteins of known three-dimensional structure. Indeed, most of these TMHs do not insert efficiently into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by themselves. To test if loops or TMHs immediately upstream or downstream of a marginally hydrophobic helix might influence the insertion efficiency, insertion of marginally hydrophobic helices was also studied in the presence of their neighboring loops and helices. The results show that flanking loops and nearest-neighbor TMHs are sufficient to ensure the insertion of many marginally hydrophobic helices. However, for at least two of the marginally hydrophobic helices, the local interactions are not enough, indicating that post-insertional rearrangements are involved in the folding of these proteins. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that the 'threshold hydrophobicity' required for insertion into the ER membrane is very similar in S. cerevisiae and in mammalian cells. Further, when comparing the contributions to the apparent free energy of membrane insertion of the 20 natural amino acids between the S. cerevisiae and the mammalian ER, we find that the two scales are strongly correlated but that the absolute difference between the most hydrophobic and most hydrophilic residues is ∼ 2-fold smaller in S. cerevisiae. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A substantial proportion of the genome encodes membrane proteins that are delivered to the endoplasmic reticulum by dedicated targeting pathways. Membrane proteins that fail targeting must be rapidly degraded to avoid aggregation and disruption of cytosolic protein homeostasis. The mechanisms of mislocalized protein (MLP) degradation are unknown. Here we reconstitute MLP degradation in vitro to identify factors involved in this pathway. We find that nascent membrane proteins tethered to ribosomes are not substrates for ubiquitination unless they are released into the cytosol. Their inappropriate release results in capture by the Bag6 complex, a recently identified ribosome-associating chaperone. Bag6-complex-mediated capture depends on the presence of unprocessed or non-inserted hydrophobic domains that distinguish MLPs from potential cytosolic proteins. A subset of these Bag6 complex 'clients' are transferred to TRC40 for insertion into the membrane, whereas the remainder are rapidly ubiquitinated. Depletion of the Bag6 complex selectively impairs the efficient ubiquitination of MLPs. Thus, by its presence on ribosomes that are synthesizing nascent membrane proteins, the Bag6 complex links targeting and ubiquitination pathways. We propose that such coupling allows the fast tracking of MLPs for degradation without futile engagement of the cytosolic folding machinery.},

abstract = {The fusion of transport vesicles with their target membranes is fundamental for intracellular membrane trafficking and diverse physiological processes and is driven by the assembly of functional soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes. Prior to fusion, transport vesicles are physically linked to their target membranes by various tethering factors. Recent studies suggest that tethering factors also positively regulate the assembly of functional SNARE complexes, thereby coupling tethering with fusion events. This coupling is mediated, at least in part, by direct physical interactions between tethering factors, SNAREs, and Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins. In this review we summarize recent progress in understanding the roles of tethering factors in the assembly of specific and functional SNARE complexes driving membrane-fusion events. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {On average, every fifth residue in secretory proteins carries either a positive or a negative charge. In a bacterium such as Escherichia coli, charged residues are exposed to an electric field as they transit through the inner membrane, and this should generate a fluctuating electric force on a translocating nascent chain. Here, we have used translational arrest peptides as in vivo force sensors to measure this electric force during cotranslational chain translocation through the SecYEG translocon. We find that charged residues experience a biphasic electric force as they move across the membrane, including an early component with a maximum when they are 47-49 residues away from the ribosomal P site, followed by a more slowly varying component. The early component is generated by the transmembrane electric potential, whereas the second may reflect interactions between charged residues and the periplasmic membrane surface.},

abstract = {Ischemia of the myocardium and lower limbs is a common consequence of arterial disease and a major source of morbidity and mortality in modernized countries. Inducing neovascularization for the treatment of ischemia is an appealing therapeutic strategy for patients for whom traditional treatment modalities cannot be performed or are ineffective. In the past, the stimulation of blood vessel growth was pursued using direct delivery of growth factors, angiogenic gene therapy, or cellular therapy. Although therapeutic angiogenesis holds great promise for treating patients with ischemia, current methods have not found success in clinical trials. Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) was one of the first growth factors to be tested for use in therapeutic angiogenesis. Here, we present a method for improving the biological activity of FGF-2 by codelivering the growth factor with a liposomally embedded coreceptor, syndecan-4. This technique was shown to increase FGF-2 cellular signaling, uptake, and nuclear localization in comparison with FGF-2 alone. Delivery of syndecan-4 proteoliposomes also increased endothelial proliferation, migration, and angiogenic tube formation in response to FGF-2. Using an animal model of limb ischemia, syndecan-4 proteoliposomes markedly improved the neovascularization following femoral artery ligation and recovery of perfusion of the ischemic limb. Taken together, these results support liposomal delivery of syndecan-4 as an effective means to improving the potential of using growth factors to achieve therapeutic neovascularization of ischemic tissue.},

The case of the trans-membrane water-channel protein aquaporin GlpF from E. coli imbedded in lipid-bilayer membranes is discussed in some detail. Numerical data obtained from Molecular Dynamics simulations show on the one side that the lipid bilayer adapts to the channel by a hydrophobic matching condition which reflects the propensity of the lipid molecules for forming curved structures. On the other side, it is demonstrated that the transport function of the channel is modulated by the matching condition and/or the curvature stress in a lipid-specific manner. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that a significant proportion of proteins are targeted to and inserted into the ER membrane post-translationally, that is after their synthesis is complete. These proteins must be efficiently captured and delivered to the target membrane, and indeed a failure to do so may even disrupt proteostasis resulting in cellular dysfunction and disease.

To test the function of the apolar constriction, we have mutated all six ring residues of yeast Sec61p to more hydrophilic, bulky, or even charged amino acids (alanines, glycines, serines, tryptophans, lysines, or aspartates). The translocon was found to be surprisingly tolerant even to the charge mutations in the constriction ring, because growth and translocation efficiency were not drastically affected. Most interestingly, ring mutants were found to affect the integration of hydrophobic sequences into the lipid bilayer, indicating that the translocon does not simply catalyze the partitioning of potential transmembrane segments between an aqueous environment and the lipid bilayer but that it also plays an active role in setting the hydrophobicity threshold for membrane integration.},

Transmembrane helices exist in the relatively uniform low dielectric interstices of the lipid bilayer, largely devoid of water and with a very hydrophobic distribution of amino acid residues. Here, through an analysis of bacteriorhodopsin crystal structures and the transmembrane helix structure from M2 protein of influenza A, some helices are shown to be exceptionally uniform in hydrogen bond geometry, peptide plane tilt angle, and backbone torsion angles. Evidence from both the x-ray crystal structures and solid-state NMR structure suggests that the intramolecular backbone hydrogen bonds are shorter than their counterparts in water-soluble proteins. Moreover, the geometry is consistent with a dominance of electrostatic versus covalent contributions to these bonds. A comparison of structure as a function of resolution shows that as the structures become better characterized the helices become much more uniform, suggesting that there is a possibility that many more uniform helices will be observed, even among the moderate resolution membrane protein structures that are currently in the Protein Data Bank that do not show such features.},

The orientation in the membrane of 27 proteins from the SMR family was determined using the reporter fusion technique. Nine members were encoded monocistronically (singles) and shown to insert in both orientations (dual topology). Eighteen members were encoded in pairs on the chromosome and shown to insert in fixed orientations; the two proteins in each pair invariably had opposite orientations in the membrane. Interaction between the two proteins in pairs was demonstrated by copurification. The orientation in the membrane of either protein in the pair was affected only marginally by the presence of the other protein.For the proteins in pairs, the orientation in the membrane correlated well with the distribution of positively charges residues (R. +. K) over the cytoplasmic and extracellular loops (positive-inside rule). In contrast, dual-topology insertion of the singles was predicted less well by the positive-inside rule. Three singles were predicted to insert in a single orientation with the N-terminus and the C-terminus at the extracellular side of the membrane. Analysis of charge distributions suggests the requirement of a threshold number of charges in the cytoplasmic loops for the positive-inside rule to be of predictive value. It is concluded that a combined analysis of gene organization on the chromosome and phylogeny is sufficient to distinguish between fixed or dual topology of SMR members and, probably, similar types of membrane proteins. The positive-inside rule can be used to predict the orientation of members in pairs, but is not suitable as a sole predictor of dual topology. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Tail-anchored (TA) proteins function in key cellular processes in eukaryotic cells, such as vesicle trafficking, protein translocation and regulation of transcription. They anchor to internal cell membranes by a C-terminal transmembrane domain, which also serves as a targeting sequence. Targeting occurs post-translationally, via pathways that are specific to the precursor, which makes TA proteins a model system for investigating post-translational protein targeting. Bioinformatics approaches have previously been used to identify potential TA proteins in yeast and humans, yet little is known about TA proteins in plants. The identification of plant TA proteins is important for extending the post-translational model system to plastids, in addition to general proteome characterization, and the identification of functional homologues characterized in other organisms. We identified 454 loci that potentially encode TA proteins in Arabidopsis, and combined published data with new localization experiments to assign localizations to 130 proteins, including 29 associated with plastids. By analysing the tail anchor sequences of characterized proteins, we have developed a tool for predicting localization and estimate that 138 TA proteins are localized to plastids.},

We present a detailed analysis of TMHMM's performance, and show that it correctly predicts 97-98 {\%} of the transmembrane helices. Additionally, TMHMM can discriminate between soluble and membrane proteins with both specificity and sensitivity better than 99 {\%}, although the accuracy drops when signal peptides are present. This high degree of accuracy allowed us to predict reliably integral membrane proteins in a large collection of genomes. Based on these predictions, we estimate that 20-30 {\%} of all genes in most genomes encode membrane proteins, which is in agreement with previous estimates. We further discovered that proteins with N(in)-C(in) topologies are strongly preferred in all examined organisms, except Caenorhabditis elegans, where the large number of 7TM receptors increases the counts for N(out)-C(in) topologies. We discuss the possible relevance of this finding for our understanding of membrane protein assembly mechanisms. A TMHMM prediction service is available at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/.},

abstract = {A computer program that progressively evaluates the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of a protein along its amino acid sequence has been devised. For this purpose, a hydropathy scale has been composed wherein the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of each of the 20 amino acid side-chains is taken into consideration. The scale is based on an amalgam of experimental observations derived from the literature. The program uses a moving-segment approach that continuously determines the average hydropathy within a segment of predetermined length as it advances through the sequence. The consecutive scores are plotted from the amino to the carboxy terminus. At the same time, a midpoint line is printed that corresponds to the grand average of the hydropathy of the amino acid compositions found in most of the sequenced proteins. In the case of soluble, globular proteins there is a remarkable correspondence between the interior portions of their sequence and the regions appearing on the hydrophobic side of the midpoint line, as well as the exterior portions and the regions on the hydrophilic side. The correlation was demonstrated by comparisons between the plotted values and known structures determined by crystallography. In the case of membrane-bound proteins, the portions of their sequences that are located within the lipid bilayer are also clearly delineated by large uninterrupted areas on the hydrophobic side of the midpoint line. As such, the membrane-spanning segments of these proteins can be identified by this procedure. Although the method is not unique and embodies principles that have long been appreciated, its simplicity and its graphic nature make it a very useful tool for the evaluation of protein structures. ?? 1982.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The BAG6 protein is a subunit of a heterotrimeric complex that binds a range of membrane and secretory protein precursors localized to the cytosol, enforcing quality control and influencing their subsequent fate.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: BAG6 has an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain, and a C-terminal Bcl-2-associated athanogene domain, separated by a large central proline-rich region. We have used in vitro binding approaches to identify regions of BAG6 important for its interactions with: i) the small-glutamine rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein alpha (SGTA) and ii) two model tail-anchored membrane proteins as a paradigm for its hydrophobic substrates. We show that the BAG6-UBL is essential for binding to SGTA, and find that the UBL of a second subunit of the BAG6-complex, ubiquitin-like protein 4A (UBL4A), competes for SGTA binding. Our data show that this binding is selective, and suggest that SGTA can bind either BAG6, or UBL4A, but not both at the same time. We adapted our in vitro binding assay to study the association of BAG6 with an immobilized tail-anchored protein, Sec61$\beta$, and find both the UBL and BAG domains are dispensable for binding this substrate. This conclusion was further supported using a heterologous subcellular localization assay in yeast, where the BAG6-dependent nuclear relocalization of a second tail-anchored protein, GFP-Sed5, also required neither the UBL, nor the BAG domain of BAG6.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSIGNIFICANCE: On the basis of these findings, we propose a working model where the large central region of the BAG6 protein provides a binding site for a diverse group of substrates, many of which expose a hydrophobic stretch of polypeptide. This arrangement would enable the BAG6 complex to bring together its substrates with potential effectors including those recruited via its N-terminal UBL. Such effectors may include SGTA, and the resulting assemblies influence the subsequent fate of the hydrophobic BAG6 substrates.},

abstract = {Motivation: Accurate prediction of contacts between $\beta$-strand residues can significantly contribute towards ab initio prediction of the 3D structure of many proteins. Contacts in the same protein are highly interdependent. Therefore, significant improvements can be expected by applying statistical relational learners that overcome the usual machine learning assumption that examples are independent and identically distributed. Furthermore, the dependencies among $\beta$-residue contacts are subject to strong regularities, many of which are known a priori. In this article, we take advantage of Markov logic, a statistical relational learning framework that is able to capture dependencies between contacts, and constrain the solution according to domain knowledge expressed by means of weighted rules in a logical language.Results: We introduce a novel hybrid architecture based on neural and Markov logic networks with grounding-specific weights. On a non-redundant dataset, our method achieves 44.9{\%} F1 measure, with 47.3{\%} precision and 42.7{\%} recall, which is significantly better (P {\textless} 0.01) than previously reported performance obtained by 2D recursive neural networks. Our approach also significantly improves the number of chains for which $\beta$-strands are nearly perfectly paired (36{\%} of the chains are predicted with F1 ≥ 70{\%} on coarse map). It also outperforms more general contact predictors on recent CASP 2008 targets.Contact: lippi@dsi.unifi.itSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. },

abstract = {Motivated by ongoing efforts to understand the mechanism of membrane protein crystallogenesis and transport in the lipidic cubic phase, the nature of the interaction between tryptophan and the bilayer/aqueous interface of the cubic phase has been investigated. The association was quantified by partitioning measurements that enabled the free energy of interaction to be determined. Temperature-dependent partitioning was used to parse the association free energy change into its enthalpic and entropic components. As has been observed with tryptophan derivatives interacting with glycerophospholipid bilayers in vesicles, tryptophan partitioning in the cubic phase is enthalpy driven. This is in contrast to partitioning into apolar solvents, which exhibits the classic hydrophobic effect whose hallmark is a favorable entropy change. These results with tryptophan are somewhat surprising given the simplicity, homogeneity, and curvature of the interface that prevails in the case of the cubic phase. Nevertheless, the interaction between tryptophan and the mesophase is very slight as revealed by its low partition coefficient. Additional evidence in support of the interaction was obtained by electronic absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and fluorescence quenching. Partitioning proved insensitive to the lipid composition of the membrane, examined by doping with glycerophospholipids. However, the interaction could be manipulated in meaningful ways by the inclusion in the aqueous medium of salt, glycerol, or urea. The effects seen with tryptophan were amplified rationally when measurements were repeated using tryptophan alkyl esters and with tryptophan peptides of increasing length. These findings are interpreted in the context of the insertion, folding, and function of proteins in membranes.},

We find that the formation of compact structure of the polyalanine sequence depends on its location. Calculation of free energies for the equilibria between folded and unfolded nascent peptides in different regions of the tunnel shows that there are zones of secondary structure formation inside the ribosomal exit tunnel.

Yet how nonubiquitinated proteins, such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, enter MVBs is unclear, supporting the possibility of mechanistically distinct ILV biogenesis pathways. Here we show that a family of highly ubiquitinated tetraspan Cos proteins provides a Ub signal in trans, allowing sorting of nonubiquitinated MVB cargo into the canonical ESCRT- and Ub-dependent pathway. Cos proteins create discrete endosomal subdomains that concentrate Ub cargo prior to their envelopment into ILVs, and the activity of Cos proteins is required not only for efficient sorting of canonical Ub cargo but also for sorting nonubiquitinated cargo into MVBs. Expression of these proteins increases during nutrient stress through an NAD{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}/Sir2-dependent mechanism that in turn accelerates the downregulation of a broad range of cell-surface proteins.},

Cleavage in the membrane-spanning portion of the signal peptide promotes the release of signal peptide fragments from the lipid bilayer. Typical processes that include intramembrane proteolysis is the regulatory or signalling function of cleavage products.

These proteins, like the vast majority of mitochondrial proteins, are encoded in the nucleus and have to be imported into the organelle. Currently, the mechanisms by which they are targeted to and inserted into the OM (outer membrane) are unclear. To shed light on these issues, we employed a recombinant version of the SA protein OM45 and a synthetic peptide corresponding to its signal-anchor segment. Both forms are associated with isolated mitochondria independently of cytosolic factors. Interaction with mitochondria was diminished when a mutated form of the signal-anchor was employed. We demonstrate that the signal-anchor peptide acquires an $\alpha$-helical structure in a lipid environment and adopted a TM (transmembrane) topology within artificial lipid bilayers. Moreover, the peptide's affinity to artificial membranes with OM-like lipid composition was much higher than that of membranes with ER (endoplasmic reticulum)-like lipid composition. Collectively, our results suggest that SA proteins are specifically inserted into the MOM by a process that is not dependent on additional proteins, but is rather facilitated by the distinct lipid composition of this membrane.},

The As values of proteins are correlated with their molecular weight (Mr) in the range 4000 to 35,000: the power law As = 6.3 M0.73 predicts protein As values to within 4{\%} on average.

The molecular surface buried inside the protein is 58{\%} non-polar, 39{\%} polar and 4{\%} charged. The buried surface contains more uncharged polar groups (mostly peptides) than the surface that remains accessible, but many fewer charged groups. On average, 15{\%} of residues in small proteins and 32{\%} in larger ones may be classed as "buried residues", having less than 5{\%} of their surface accessible to the solvent. The accessibilities of most other residues are evenly distributed in the range 5 to 50{\%}.

From amino acid compositions of protein surfaces and interiors we calculate an effective coefficient of partition for each type of residue, and derive an implied set of transfer free energy values. This is compared with other sets of partition coefficients derived directly from experimental data. The extent to which groups of residues (charged, polar and non-polar) are buried within proteins correlates well with their hydrophobicity derived from amino acid transfer experiments. Within these three groups, the correlation is low. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

abstract = {We have studied the effects of single charged residues on the position of a model transmembrane helix in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane using the glycosylation mapping technique. Asp and Glu residues cause a re-positioning of the C-terminal end of the transmembrane helix when placed in the one to two C-terminal turns but not when placed more centrally. Arg and Lys residues, in contrast, have little effect when placed in the two C-terminal turn but give rise to a more substantial shift in position when placed 9-11 residues from the helix end. We suggest that this difference between the effects of positively and negatively charged residues can be explained by the so-called snorkel effect, i.e. that the very long side-chains of Arg and Lys can reach up along the transmembrane helix to allow the terminal, charged moiety to reside in the lipid headgroup region while the Calpha of the residue is positioned well below the membrane/water interface.},

Walter. 1991. Cell. 67:131-144). We have established that the two targeting pathways function in parallel. Mutant alleles of SEC62 and SEC63 were isolated that specifically impaired the translocation of SRP-independent preproteins in vivo and in vitro, whereas SRP-dependent preproteins were unaffected. Based on this analysis, preproteins fall into three distinct classes: SRP dependent, SRP independent, and those that can use both pathways. Pathway specificity is conferred by the hydrophobic core of signal sequences. Our studies show a previously unrecognized diversity in ER-directed signal sequences, that carry structural information that serves to identify the route taken.},

abstract = {The signal recognition particle (SRP) cotranslationally recognizes signal sequences of secretory proteins and targets ribosome-nascent chain complexes to the SRP receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, initiating translocation of the nascent chain through the Sec61 translocon. Although signal sequences do not have homology, they have similar structural regions: a positively charged N-terminus, a hydrophobic core and a more polar C-terminal region that contains the cleavage site for the signal peptidase. Here, we have used site-specific photocrosslinking to study SRP-signal sequence interactions. A photoreactive probe was incorporated into the middle of wild-type or mutated signal sequences of the secretory protein preprolactin by in vitro translation of mRNAs containing an amber-stop codon in the signal peptide in the presence of the N??-(5-azido-2 nitrobenzoyl)-Lys-tRNAamb amber suppressor. A homogeneous population of SRP-ribosome-nascent chain complexes was obtained by the use of truncated mRNAs in translations performed in the presence of purified canine SRP. Quantitative analysis of the photoadducts revealed that charged residues at the N-terminus of the signal sequence or in the early part of the mature protein have only a mild effect on the SRP-signal sequence association. However, deletions of amino acid residues in the hydrophobic portion of the signal sequence severely affect SRP binding. The photocrosslinking data correlate with targeting efficiency and translocation across the membrane. Thus, the hydrophobic core of the signal sequence is primarily responsible for its recognition and binding by SRP, while positive charges fine-tune the SRP-signal sequence affinity and targeting to the translocon.},

Here, we report a SNARE protein-based method for incorporation of multiple membrane proteins into artificial membrane vesicles of well-defined composition, and for delivery of large water-soluble substrates into these vesicles. The approach is used for in vitro reconstruction of a fully functional bacterial respiratory chain from purified components. Furthermore, the method is used for functional incorporation of the entire F1F0 ATP synthase complex into native bacterial membranes from which this component had been genetically removed. The novel methodology offers a tool to investigate complex interaction networks between membrane-bound proteins at a molecular level, which is expected to generate functional insights into key cellular functions.},

abstract = {Many proteins are translocated through the SecY channel in bacteria and archaea and through the related Sec61 channel in eukaryotes. The channel has an hourglass shape with a narrow constriction approximately halfway across the membrane, formed by a pore ring of amino acids. While the cytoplasmic cavity of the channel is empty, the extracellular cavity is filled with a short helix called the plug, which moves out of the way during protein translocation. The mechanism by which the channel transports large polypeptides and yet prevents the passage of small molecules, such as ions or metabolites, has been controversial. Here, we have addressed this issue in intact Escherichia coli cells by testing the permeation of small molecules through wild-type and mutant SecY channels, which are either in the resting state or contain a defined translocating polypeptide chain. We show that in the resting state, the channel is sealed by both the pore ring and the plug domain. During translocation, the pore ring forms a 'gasket-like' seal around the polypeptide chain, preventing the permeation of small molecules. The structural conservation of the channel in all organisms indicates that this may be a universal mechanism by which the membrane barrier is maintained during protein translocation.},

abstract = {The recognition of transmembrane helices by the translocon is primarily guided by the average hydrophobicity of the potential transmembrane helix. However, the exact hydrophobicity of each amino acid can be identified in several different ways. The free energy of transfer for amino acid analogues between a hydrophobic media, for example, octanol and water can be measured or obtained from simulations, the hydrophobicity can also be estimated by statistical properties from known transmembrane segments and finally the contribution of each amino acid type for the probability of translocon recognition has recently been measured directly. Although these scales correlate quite well, there are clear differences between them and it is not well understood which scale represents neither the biology best nor what the differences are. Here, we try to provide some answers to this by studying the ability of different scales to recognize transmembrane helices and predict the topology of transmembrane proteins. From this analysis it is clear that the biological hydrophobicity scale as well scales created from statistical analysis of membrane helices perform better than earlier experimental scales that are mainly based on measurements of amino acid analogs and not directly on transmembrane helix recognition. Using these results we identified the properties of the scales that perform better than other scales. We find, for instance, that the better performing scales consider proline more hydrophilic. This shows that transmembrane recognition is not only governed by pure hydrophobicity but also by the helix preferences for amino acids, as proline is a strong helix breaker.},

For comparison, polarity profiles were also calculated for ten artificial lipid bilayers that have been previously studied by neutron and X-ray scattering. Estimated hydrophobic thicknesses are 30-31{\AA} for proteins from endoplasmic reticulum, thylakoid, and various bacterial plasma membranes, but differ for proteins from outer bacterial, inner mitochondrial and eukaryotic plasma membranes (23.9, 28.6 and 33.5{\AA}, respectively). Protein and lipid polarity parameters abruptly change in the lipid carbonyl zone that matches the calculated hydrophobic boundaries. Maxima of positively charged protein groups correspond to the location of lipid phosphates at 20-22{\AA} distances from the membrane center. Locations of Tyr atoms coincide with hydrophobic boundaries, while distributions maxima of Trp rings are shifted by 3-4{\AA} toward the membrane center. Distributions of Trp atoms indicate the presence of two 5-8{\AA}-wide midpolar regions with intermediate $\pi$* values within the hydrocarbon core, whose size and symmetry depend on the lipid composition of membrane leaflets. Midpolar regions are especially asymmetric in outer bacterial membranes and cell membranes of mesophilic but not hyperthermophilic archaebacteria, indicating the larger width of the central nonpolar region in the later case. In artificial lipid bilayers, midpolar regions are observed up to the level of acyl chain double bonds.},

The study of tail-anchored proteins has provided a paradigm for understanding the components and pathways that mediate post-translational biogenesis of membrane proteins at the endoplasmic reticulum.

abstract = {Tail-anchored (TA) protein synthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) represents a distinct and novel process that provides a paradigm for understanding post-translational membrane insertion in eukaryotes. The major route for delivering TA proteins to the ER requires both ATP and one or more cytosolic factors that facilitate efficient membrane insertion. Until recently, the identity of these cytosolic components was elusive, but two candidates have now been suggested to promote ATP-dependent TA protein integration. The first is the cytosolic chaperone complex of Hsp40/Hsc70, and the second is a novel ATPase denoted Asna-1 or TRC40. In this study we focus on the role of the Hsp40/Hsc70 complex in promoting TA protein biogenesis at the ER. We show that the membrane integration of most TA proteins is stimulated by Hsp40/Hsc70 when using purified components and a reconstituted system. In contrast, when both Hsp40/Hsc70 and Asna-1/TRC40 are provided as a complete system, small molecule inhibition of Hsp40/Hsc70 indicates that only a subset of TA proteins are obligatory clients for this chaperone-mediated delivery route. We show that the hydrophobicity of the TA region dictates whether a precursor is delivered to the ER via the Hsp40/Hsc70 or Asna-1/TRC40-dependent route, and we conclude that these distinct cytosolic ATPases are responsible for two different ATP-dependent pathways of TA protein biogenesis.},

abstract = {During polytopic protein biogenesis, the Sec61 translocon must rapidly orient and integrate multiple transmembrane segments (TMs) into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. To understand this process, we examined interactions between Sec61alpha and all six TMs of the aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channel at defined stages of synthesis using incorporated photo-cross-linking probes. Each TM interacted with and moved through the translocon in a highly ordered and sequential fashion. Strong asymmetric Sec61alpha cross-linking was observed for only one helix at a time, suggesting the presence of a single primary binding site. However, up to four TMs simultaneously contacted Sec61alpha from different molecular environments. Thus, AQP4 integration by Sec61alpha involves sequential triage of TMs from their initial portal of entry into multiple secondary sites within the translocon. This mechanism provides a means to facilitate early folding events before release into the lipid bilayer.},

abstract = {The Glut1 glucose transporter is a glycoprotein whose membrane topology has been verified by a number of experimental observations, all of which are consistent with a 12-transmembrane helix model originally based on hydrophobicity analysis. We used Glut1 as a model multispanning membrane protein to test the Charge Difference Hypothesis (Hartmann, E., Rapoport, T. A., and Lodish, H. F. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 86, 5786-5790), which asserts that the topology of a eucaryotic multispanning membrane protein is determined solely by the amino acid charge difference across the first transmembrane segment. The charge difference across the first transmembrane segment of Glut1 was progressively inverted in two independent series of mutants, one series in which only the number of positively charged amino acid residues in the two flanking domains was altered and the other in which only the number of negatively charged residues in the two flanking domains was changed. The results indicate that the charge difference across the first transmembrane segment does affect the topology of the protein, but that contrary to the hypothesis, it only dictates the orientation of the first transmembrane segment and the disposition of the amino terminus and the first linker domain. Charge inversion resulted in the formation of aberrant molecules in which either the first or second transmembrane segment failed to insert into the membrane. The topology of downstream regions of Glut1 was unaffected by charge inversion across the first transmembrane segment, indicating that downstream sequences are important in determining the local topological disposition of the molecule.},

abstract = {The various membranes of eukaryotic cells differ in composition, but it is at present unclear if this results in differences in physical properties. The sequences of transmembrane domains (TMDs) of integral membrane proteins should reflect the physical properties of the bilayers in which they reside. We used large datasets from both fungi and vertebrates to perform a comprehensive comparison of the TMDs of proteins from different organelles. We find that TMDs are not generic but have organelle-specific properties with a dichotomy in TMD length between the early and late parts of the secretory pathway. In addition, TMDs from post-ER organelles show striking asymmetries in amino acid compositions across the bilayer that is linked to residue size and varies between organelles. The pervasive presence of organelle-specific features among the TMDs of a particular organelle has implications for TMD prediction, regulation of protein activity by location, and sorting of proteins and lipids in the secretory pathway. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Here, we directly determine the partitioning free energies of a family of designed peptides using three independent approaches: an experimental microsomal Sec61 translocon assay, a biophysical (spectroscopic) characterization of peptide insertion into hydrated planar lipid bilayer arrays, and an unbiased atomic-detail equilibrium folding-partitioning molecular dynamics simulation. Remarkably, the measured free energies of insertion are quantitatively similar for all three approaches. The molecular dynamics simulations show that TM helix insertion involves equilibrium with the membrane interface, suggesting that the interface may play a role in translocon-guided insertion.},

abstract = {The translocon recognizes transmembrane helices with sufficient level of hydrophobicity and inserts them into the membrane. However, sometimes less hydrophobic helices are also recognized. Positive inside rule, orientational preferences of and specific interactions with neighboring helices have been shown to aid in the recognition of these helices, at least in artificial systems. To better understand how the translocon inserts marginally hydrophobic helices, we studied three naturally occurring marginally hydrophobic helices, which were previously shown to require the subsequent helix for efficient translocon recognition. We find no evidence for specific interactions when we scan all residues in the subsequent helices. Instead, we identify arginines located at the N-terminal part of the subsequent helices that are crucial for the recognition of the marginally hydrophobic transmembrane helices, indicating that the positive inside rule is important. However, in two of the constructs, these arginines do not aid in the recognition without the rest of the subsequent helix; that is, the positive inside rule alone is not sufficient. Instead, the improved recognition of marginally hydrophobic helices can here be explained as follows: the positive inside rule provides an orientational preference of the subsequent helix, which in turn allows the marginally hydrophobic helix to be inserted; that is, the effect of the positive inside rule is stronger if positively charged residues are followed by a transmembrane helix. Such a mechanism obviously cannot aid C-terminal helices, and consequently, we find that the terminal helices in multi-spanning membrane proteins are more hydrophobic than internal helices. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

If this is indeed the case, it should be possible to predictably alter the topology of a polytopic protein by site-directed insertions and/or deletions of positively charged residues in critical locations. I now describe a derivative of Escherichia coli leader peptidase, a polytopic inner-membrane protein, that switches from sec-gene-dependent membrane insertion with a Nout-Cout transmembrane topology to sec-gene-independent insertion with a Nin-Cin topology in response to the addition of four positively charged lysines to its N terminus.},

abstract = {Prediction and engineering of protein solubility is an important but imprecise area. While some features are routinely used, such as the avoidance of extensive non-polar surface area, scope remains for benchmarking of sequence and structural features with experimental data. We study properties in the context of experimental solubilities, protein gene expression levels, and families of abundant proteins (serum albumin and myoglobin) and their less abundant paralogues. A common feature that emerges for proteins with elevated solubility and at higher expression and abundance levels is an increased ratio of lysine content to arginine content. We suggest that the same properties of arginine that give rise to its recorded propensity for specific interaction surfaces also lead to favorable interactions at nonspecific contacts, and thus lysine is favored for proteins at relatively high concentration. A survey of protein therapeutics shows that a significant subset possesses a relatively low lysine to arginine ratio, and therefore may not be favored for high protein concentration. We conclude that modulation of lysine and arginine content could prove a useful and relatively simple addition to the toolkit available for engineering protein solubility in biotechnological applications.},

abstract = {Membrane proteins are a greasy lot. Thrown into water without detergents, they form intractable aggregates, which minimize exposure of their nonpolar transmem- brane surfaces to water. Aggregation would be their cer- tain fate if membrane proteins were translated on the ribosome in the manner of soluble proteins. But this fate is avoided: the elongating polypeptide segment from the ribosome exit tunnel (Voss et al., 2006) passes into the membrane-dwelling translocon assembly whose architecture permits selected segments to enter the membrane bilayer to become transmembrane (TM) he- lices (for review see White and von Heijne, 2004, 2005; von Heijne, 2006). The principles underlying this selec- tion process are beginning to emerge from our recent studies of the recognition of transmembrane helices by the ER translocon (Hessa et al., 2005a; Meindl-Beinker et al., 2006). As Gunnar von Heijne discusses in his Per- spective (p. 353), one outcome of our experiments was a “biological” hydrophobicity scale that describes the apparent free energy of insertion (∆Gapp) of each of the 20 natural amino acids when located in the center of a hydrophobic TM helix. This biological scale correlated strongly with the so-called Wimley-White (1999) physical hydrophobicity scales, suggesting that, somehow, the translocon selection of TM segments fol- lows general thermodynamic principles that underlie partitioning of peptides between water and n-octanol (Wimley et al., 1996). The primary goal of this Perspec- tive is to explore this intriguing nexus between biology and physical chemistry. One of the motivations for this series of Perspectives is to gain deeper insights into the connection between the biological hydrophobicity scale and physical scales, especially the Wimley-White (1999) octanol scale. Our current understanding of membranes, hydrophobicity, and membrane protein stability originates from the Fluid Mosaic Membrane Model (Singer and Nicolson, 1972). I therefore begin by reviewing the origins of this conceptual model, which is built upon the fundamental idea that hydrophobic molecules (e.g., membrane pro- teins) partition between water and immiscible nonpolar phases (e.g., lipid bilayers). Because this concept arose before our understanding of the structure and dynamics of fluid bilayers was complete, I next discuss the mod- ern view of lipid bilayer structure and dynamics, which is essential for connecting the biological and physical scales. Implicit in the motivation for this Perspectives series is the apparent ability of the translocon to insert charge-containing TM helices across the ER membrane. I discuss how this might work in the light of the modern view of bilayer structure. This sets the stage for consid- ering why the biological hydrophobicity scale correlates so strongly with the Wimley-White octanol scale. I at- tempt to provide an explanation. To begin to connect the biological and physical hydrophobicity scales, I then discuss insights into translocon function obtained from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of SecY/Sec61 heterotrimer in lipid bilayers. I argue that the heterotri- mer is ideally suited to serve as a thermodynamic switch that determines whether or not a polypeptide segment passes into the lipid bilayer as a TM segment. Finally, I consider whether TM helix recognition by the translo- con is equivalent to direct partitioning of helices be- tween water and lipid bilayer.},

abstract = {Like all cellular proteins, membrane proteins are synthesized by ribosomes. But unlike their soluble counterparts, highly hydrophobic membrane proteins require auxiliary machineries to prevent aggregation in aqueous cellular compartments. The principal machine is the translocon, which works in concert with ribosomes to manage the orderly insertion of alpha-helical membrane proteins directly into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of eukaryotes or into the plasma membrane of bacteria. In the course of insertion, membrane proteins come into thermodynamic equilibrium with the lipid membrane, where physicochemical interactions determine the final three-dimensional structure. Much progress has been made during the past several years toward understanding the physical chemistry of membrane protein stability, the structure of the translocon machine, and the mechanisms by which the translocon selects and inserts transmembrane helices. We review this progress and consider the connection between the physical principles of membrane protein stability and translocon selection of transmembrane helices.},

@article{Wong2010,
abstract = {Large-scale genome sequencing gained general importance for life science because functional annotation of otherwise experimentally uncharacterized sequences is made possible by the theory of biomolecular sequence homology. Historically, the paradigm of similarity of protein sequences implying common structure, function and ancestry was generalized based on studies of globular domains. Having the same fold imposes strict conditions over the packing in the hydrophobic core requiring similarity of hydrophobic patterns. The implications of sequence similarity among non-globular protein segments have not been studied to the same extent; nevertheless, homology considerations are silently extended for them. This appears especially detrimental in the case of transmembrane helices (TMs) and signal peptides (SPs) where sequence similarity is necessarily a consequence of physical requirements rather than common ancestry. Thus, matching of SPs/TMs creates the illusion of matching hydrophobic cores. Therefore, inclusion of SPs/TMs into domain models can give rise to wrong annotations. More than 1001 domains among the 10,340 models of Pfam release 23 and 18 domains of SMART version 6 (out of 809) contain SP/TM regions. As expected, fragment-mode HMM searches generate promiscuous hits limited to solely the SP/TM part among clearly unrelated proteins. More worryingly, we show explicit examples that the scores of clearly false-positive hits, even in global-mode searches, can be elevated into the significance range just by matching the hydrophobic runs. In the PIR iProClass database v3.74 using conservative criteria, we find that at least between 2.1{\%} and 13.6{\%} of its annotated Pfam hits appear unjustified for a set of validated domain models. Thus, false-positive domain hits enforced by SP/TM regions can lead to dramatic annotation errors where the hit has nothing in common with the problematic domain model except the SP/TM region itself. We suggest a workflow of flagging problematic hits arising from SP/TM-containing models for critical reconsideration by annotation users.},

Simple, quantitative criteria are desirable for identifying transmembrane helices (TMs) that must be included into or should be excluded from start sequence segments in similarity searches aimed at finding distant homologues.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We found that there are two types of TMs in membrane-associated proteins. On the one hand, there are so-called simple TMs with elevated hydrophobicity, low sequence complexity and extraordinary enrichment in long aliphatic residues. They merely serve as membrane-anchoring device. In contrast, so-called complex TMs have lower hydrophobicity, higher sequence complexity and some functional residues. These TMs have additional roles besides membrane anchoring such as intra-membrane complex formation, ligand binding or a catalytic role. Simple and complex TMs can occur both in single- and multi-membrane-spanning proteins essentially in any type of topology. Whereas simple TMs have the potential to confuse searches for sequence homologues and to generate unrelated hits with seemingly convincing statistical significance, complex TMs contain essential evolutionary information.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: For extending the homology concept onto membrane proteins, we provide a necessary quantitative criterion to distinguish simple TMs (and a sufficient criterion for complex TMs) in query sequences prior to their usage in homology searches based on assessment of hydrophobicity and sequence complexity of the TM sequence segments.},

abstract = {Transmembrane helical segments (TMs) can be classified into two groups of so-called 'simple' and 'complex' TMs. Whereas the first group represents mere hydrophobic anchors with an overrepresentation of aliphatic hydrophobic residues that are likely attributed to convergent evolution in many cases, the complex ones embody ancestral information and tend to have structural and functional roles beyond just membrane immersion. Hence, the sequence homology concept is not applicable on simple TMs. In practice, these simple TMs can attract statistically significant but evolutionarily unrelated hits during similarity searches (whether through BLAST- or HMM-based approaches). This is especially problematic for membrane proteins that contain both globular segments and TMs. As such, we have developed the transmembrane helix: simple or complex (TMSOC) webserver for the identification of simple and complex TMs. By masking simple TM segments in seed sequences prior to sequence similarity searches, the false-discovery rate decreases without sacrificing sensitivity. Therefore, TMSOC is a novel and necessary sequence analytic tool for both the experimentalists and the computational biology community working on membrane proteins.

Compositional complexity is based only on residue composition, regardless of the patterns or periodicity of sequence repetitiveness. This contrasts with some alternative methods that use counts of k-grams to define residue patterns and clustering. Complexity, pattern, and periodicity are distinct abstract attributes of simple sequences. For genomic studies, it is essential to view compositional bias in the context of many types of other features, such as recognizable functional sites, transcripts, coding sequences, and homologies.

abstract = {Abstract: One of the ubiquitous features of membrane proteins is the preference of tryptophan and tyrosine residues for membrane surfaces that presumably arises from enhanced stability due to distinct interfacial interactions. The physical basis for this preference is widely believed to arise from amphipathic interactions related to imino group hydrogen bonding and/or dipole interactions. We have examined these and other possibilities for tryptophan's interfacial preference by using 1H magic angle spinning (MAS) chemical shift measurements, two-dimensional (2D) nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (2D-NOESY) 1H MAS NMR, and solid state 2H NMR to study the interactions of four tryptophan analogues with phosphatidylcholine membranes. We find that the analogues reside in the vicinity of the glycerol group where they all cause similar modest changes in acyl chain organization and that hydrocarbon penetration was not increased by reduction of hydrogen bonding or electric dipole interaction ability. These observations rule out simple amphipathic or dipolar interactions as the physical basis for the interfacial preference. More likely, the preference is dominated by tryptophan's flat rigid shape that limits access to the hydrocarbon core and its electronic structure and associated quadrupolar moment (aromaticity) that favor residing in the electrostatically complex interface environment.},

abstract = {Membrane-embedded voltage-sensor domains in voltage-dependent potassium channels (K(v) channels) contain an impressive number of charged residues. How can such highly charged protein domains be efficiently inserted into biological membranes? In the plant K(v) channel KAT1, the S2, S3, and S4 transmembrane helices insert cooperatively, because the S3, S4, and S3-S4 segments do not have any membrane insertion ability by themselves. Here we show that, in the Drosophila Shaker K(v) channel, which has a more hydrophobic S3 helix than KAT1, S3 can both insert into the membrane by itself and mediate the insertion of the S3-S4 segment in the absence of S2. An engineered KAT1 S3-S4 segment in which the hydrophobicity of S3 was increased or where S3 was replaced by Shaker S3 behaves as Shaker S3-S4. Electrostatic interactions among charged residues in S2, S3, and S4, including the salt bridges between E283 or E293 in S2 and R368 in S4, are required for fully efficient membrane insertion of the Shaker voltage-sensor domain. These results suggest that cooperative insertion of the voltage-sensor transmembrane helices is a property common to K(v) channels and that the degree of cooperativity depends on a balance between electrostatic and hydrophobic forces.},

abstract = {Hydrophobicity analyses applied to databases of soluble and transmembrane (TM) proteins of known structure were used to resolve total genomic hydrophobicity profiles into (helical) TM sequences and mainly "subhydrophobic" soluble components. This information was used to define a refined "hydrophobicity"-type TM sequence prediction scale that should approach the theoretical limit of accuracy. The refinement procedure involved adjusting scale values to eliminate differences between the average amino acid composition of populations TM and soluble sequences of equal hydrophobicity, a required property of a scale having maximum accuracy. Application of this procedure to different hydrophobicity scales caused them to collapse to essentially a single TM tendency scale. As expected, when different scales were compared, the TM tendency scale was the most accurate at predicting TM sequences. It was especially highly correlated (r = 0.95) to the biological hydrophobicity scale, derived experimentally from the percent TM conformation formed by artificial sequences passing though the translocon. It was also found that resolution of total genomic sequence data into TM and soluble components could be used to define the percent probability that a sequence with a specific hydrophobicity value forms a TM segment. Application of the TM tendency scale to whole genomic data revealed an overlap of TM and soluble sequences in the "semihydrophobic" range. This raises the possibility that a significant number of proteins have sequences that can switch between TM and non-TM states. Such proteins may exist in moonlighting forms having properties very different from those of the predominant conformation.},
