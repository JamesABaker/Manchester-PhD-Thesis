GPCR distribution tables for complexity and hydrophobicity

Graphs of complexity and hydrophobicity distributions

Show there are step changes in GPCRs from Bahadur

\subsection{The pattern is present for GPCR subfamilies}
Figure of complexity distributions with Rhodopsin like, Secretin, metabotropic glutamate, Fungal mating, cyclic AMP, Frizzled and smooth.
Bahadur tables also


\subsection{The prevelance of this amongst all TMPs.}
Mechano-sensitive (controlled vocabulary if no list available) distributions
Voltage gated (controlled vocabulary if no list available) distributions


\section{Discussion}
Seen across a variety of 7TM families with varying functions with datasets built from all membrane types (hence variety).
Suggests a pressure for simpler TMHs to precede more complex ones, repeating every 3-4 TMHs.
The universality points toward translocon behaviour pressure, or thermodynamic stability in the membrane.
Would we expect this behaviour if the translocon acted on only one TMH at a time?
