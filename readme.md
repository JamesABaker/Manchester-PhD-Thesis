# About

This thesis is a modified version of the latex template thesis available at [the University of Manchester website](http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/information-for-current-students/general-information/forms-policies-regulations/latextemplates/).

Specifically the modifications allow multi-file chapter division. See comments in the `muthesis.cls` file for more specific information.

This file has a history of it's own.

# Setup & Requirements

The files use their own class and I have had no problems using the default Latex package to compile it on a few different machines. Specifically, ensure that xelatex bibtex are installed.

In shell/bash run the `runme.sh` file. This essentiially makes an attempt to guess your OS and then run an appropriate sequence that was compatible on the machines I used!
